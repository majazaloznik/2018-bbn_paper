1. Initialise repository and set up. 

2. Start `docs/potential-journals.Rmd` with list and info on possible journals to submit to. 

3. Start `docs/literature-review.Rmd` with systematic literature review. This should also be a good source of journals to submit to. 

4. Start Web of science searches, download bibliographies into Mendeley, keep track of searches and number of hits in lit-review file. total 179 files atm.
