Considering the many demographic phenomena have roots in individual choice behaviour and social interactions it is important that this behaviour is being translated in agent rules. Several behaviour theories are realevant in this context, and hence there is a necessity to use a meta-theory of behaviour as a framework for teh development of agent rules. The consumat approach provides a basis for such a framework, as is demonstrated with a discussion of modelling the diffusion of contraceptives. These diffusion processed are strongly influenced by social processes and cognitive strategiees. Different possible research lines are discussed which might be adressed with multi- agent approach like the consumats.},

"agent rules should be based on relevant theory on human decision making. Moreover relevant data should be translated in agent characteristics, so as to represent the heterogeneity of real social systems"
OK, so there is a whole strand of research focussed on modelling strategic decision making, but this is for finding optimal strategies not for mimicing real decision making. Critique of sugarscape, because there was no behaviour theoretical foundation for the agent rules. So they are offering teh consumat approach as a comprehensive meta-theory of human decision making. 

Decision making

thousands of decisions a day, so we optimize also the cognitive effort of making the choice. We use heuristics, to aviod having to make the decision from scratch. eg. we follow routines, imitate others, follow a norm.. so you can spend more time deciding on sth important. But how do we decide which strategy to employ when?},

In particular, when gains from an innovation are difficult to quantify, such as implementing quality circles or downsizing practices, diffusion is likely to occur through a bandwagon process. In this paper we extend Abrahamson and Rosenkopf's (1993) model of bandwagon diffusion to examine both reputational and informational influences on this process. We find that the distribution of reputations among the set of potential adopters affects the extent of bandwagon diffusion under conditions of moderate ambiguity, and we find that bandwagons occur even when potential adopters receive information about others' unprofitable experiences with the innovation.},

abstract = {The tools and methods developed by different scientific communities to simulate the dynamics of land use have emphasised either processes or patterns of changes. Agent-based models (ABM) belong to the former category while many spatially explicit simulation models belong to the latter. These two different modelling approaches were jointly implemented at a study site in Vietnam to assess their respective strengths and weaknesses with respect to their capacity to support the formulation of land-use policy and to influence decision-making by multiple groups of stakeholders. SAMBA is a people-centred approach combining an ABM, a role-playing game and a geographic information system. Participatory simulations help elicit the rules of the ABM and calibrate the model, while the model supports the participatory exploration of land-use change scenarios over longer time periods. CLUE-s is a spatial simulation model which explores changes in land-use patterns within user-specified rules of permissible change and rates of change. Driving factors that influence changes from one land-use type to another are defined by combining spatially explicit data on land use and supposed driving factors in a logistical regression analysis. Alternatively, the decision rules that were revealed during the participatory simulations – with the role plays and the multi-agent modelling of the SAMBA approach – were incorporated in the CLUE-s model to provide more realistic estimates for the varying influence of land-use drivers. We checked the respective validity of the two models by applying them at the same site and comparing their outputs. As a result, no single approach was obviously superior according to the validation statistics. The three approaches turned out to be complementary in simulating land-use patterns, while providing different types of information. Integration of the two models into a rule-based version of CLUE-s helped reconciling data-driven statistical models and process-driven agent-based models in LUCC research. This new model reinforced the overall framework by facilitating the partnership between researchers from different scientific communities and between researchers and multiple groups of stakeholders. It may also better respond to the expectations of land users at different levels of the decision-making hierarchy.},

abstract = {Abstract Agent-based micro-simulation models require a complete list of agents with detailed demographic/socioeconomic information for the purpose of behavior modeling and simulation. This paper introduces a new alternative for population synthesis based on Bayesian networks. A Bayesian network is a graphical representation of a joint probability distribution, encoding probabilistic relationships among a set of variables in an efficient way. Similar to the previously developed probabilistic approach, in this paper, we consider the population synthesis problem to be the inference of a joint probability distribution. In this sense, the Bayesian network model becomes an efficient tool that allows us to compactly represent/reproduce the structure of the population system and preserve privacy and confidentiality in the meanwhile. We demonstrate and assess the performance of this approach in generating synthetic population for Singapore, by using the Household Interview Travel Survey (HITS) data as the known test population. Our results show that the introduced Bayesian network approach is powerful in characterizing the underlying joint distribution, and meanwhile the overfitting of data can be avoided as much as possible.},

annote = {- "Human-nature systems used to be studied in separation" either i) human systems constrained by input/output from natural systems, or ii) natural systems subject to human disturbance
- to understand the complexity (e.g. feedback, nonlinearity, thresholds, heterogeneity, timelags) new research efforst focus on coupled human and natural systems. 
- Complexity theory - partially originating from general systems theory , usually complex xsystems are heterogenous subsystems and autonomous entities, often with nonlinear relationships and multiple interactions. 
- complexity can manifest itself in many ways: path dependence, criticality, self-organization, difficulty of prediction, emergence. (Manson2001 for history of complexity)
- more about understanding than controlling the system
- but: still in its infancy, lacks clear conceptual framework and unique tecniques..

- ABM - major bottom up tool for undestanding complexity both theoretically and empirically. "computerised simulation of a number of agents interacting through prescribed rules", they are dynamic, can learn, adapt etc. 
- philosophy of "methodological individualism" - aggregation of individuals is misleading (Busquet2004)
- intelectual origin in "object oriented programming"
- Axelrod 1997 : ABM as a third way in scientific research: start with a set of assumptions derived from teh data (deduction) and priduces simulation based data to be analysed (induction). but see couclelis 2001 in Parker 2001 for reasons agains ABM. 
- ABMs used to i) predict phenomena, ii) envision, iii) understand the systema dn andwer what if questions, iv) for theorising based on observations (e.g. comparing abm to mathematical models)
* limitations: lack of predictive power at local scales, difficulty in validation and verification (parker 2002) shortage of effectuve architectures and protocols, particulary learning processes of real agents have been poorly represented. (Bousquet and le page). 

Complexity research in CHANS "the aplication of complexity theory and its major tool AMB in CHANS is still relatievely recent" three threads:
1. IBM in ecology - relatively pure ecological studies that have fed into later CHANS ABM work. generally IBM and ABM are pretty similar, but IBM focuses more on heterogeneity and uniqueness, ABM more on the decision making process and social context. 
2. "thought experiments" in social science (segregation models, prisoners dilemma..)usually virtual environments, ad hoc rules to explore emergence. 
3. applying ABM to realistic CHANS based empirical data, usually couled with cellular automata for spactial representation.

- Advantages:i) model individual decisions, ii) using differnet behaviour theories or models e.g. econometric or bounded rationality theory, iii) can incorporate social/ecological processes, structure, norms, iv) you can put them into place into a local and spatial context. 
"CHANS largely similar to SESs by OStrom. 

- Modelling human decision making in CHANS - how are data colelcted and how agets characterised:
Direct observation, surveys or interviews, government archives, remote sensing and GOS, and/or statistical census or surveys.
- agents usually assigned real data collected at the agent level or sampled from aggregate distributions if they are not available at the micro level - buthtis may risk loosing the strenght of ABM, because teh agents may be too average and not heterogenous enough. 

- Generic decision models used in CHANS:

1) microeconomic models usually resource related decisions, agents maximize profit, revenue, rate od profit while not violating constraitns. Utiliy functins can be more abstract as well to inlcude consuption, aspiration instead of just monetary income. Eitehr way, the agents are assumed to make rational choices. In the real world this rationality is bounded by e.g. lack in knowledge and information. Also agens may choose a satisfactory level instead of the optimal utility. But even if you take all of this into account there is an inherent arbitrariness to htese models when choosing how to describe the utility function. 
2) Space tehory based models. evaluating candidate siets based on absolute or relative distance, location characteristics (e.g. slope) , so the agent calculates the suitability of a location based on these elements, but there is again a bit of arbitrariness involved in determining the weights of differnt elements..
3)Psychosocial and cognitive models agents make decisions based on their own cognitive maps and/or abilities (learning, memory, innovation), beliefs and intentions, aspirations, reputation of other agents, social norms...
i) actor centered structuration theory (ST). two way relationship actors influence and are influenced by the social structure - this is in line with feedback in many complex CHANS. and Theory of interpersonal behaviour (TIB) where intentions, habit,physiological arousal and contextual factors all impact agents decisions. Example of Intergative Agent centered frameworks, which incorporate both of these approaches (in Feola 2010 - looking at pesticide use in Colombia) but don't go far enough, they should have built an ABM and characterise the agents with the results of teh IAC model 
i) fuzzy cognitive maps - derived from cognitive maps, used primarily to compute agent behaviour in biological and ecological studies, research devotoed to human-environment interaction has meen minimal (see Jessica Thorn in zoology is doing sth similar!
iii)computational organization theory - agents learn about their environments along preconceived biases and influence others to adopt the same biases - so social learning and immitation play an important role
4) Institution based models - closely linked to previous models if you consider institutions to be a special social norm established through alw or policy. The same "institutional environment" forces people to copy each other either because of government regulation or to gain legittimacy..
5. Experience or preference based decision models - rules of thumb. strategies that can be derived from empirical (quant or qual) data. Often simple, straightforward and without the need for much justification. 
6.)Participatory agent based modes (aka companion planning?) : a variant of (5) where people "directly tell the modeller what they would do under certain conditions" . it "involves stakeholders in an iterative process of describing contexts, soliciting decisions, running the abm and envisioning scenarios arising from corresponding decisions. ! major rationale: facilitates communication between non/specialist stakeholders and specialists (modellers). it incorporates on-site decision making by real peole, facilitates information sharing, collective learning... Role playing is a particular application for soliciting decision rules through direct obbservation of the players' behaviour (review in DAquino2002) see also calstella and esp naivinit!!
7) empirical or heuristic rules - are obtained through empirical data or observations eg. through cluster analysis. - these are not as straightforward as the 'rules of thumb'. Some ruels can be modelled in a stochastic manner e.g. the probability of getting married at a certain age.. Sometiems neural or decision trees are used to learn the rules from empirical data. (balck or grey box apporach). Antoher option is to group agents by some sort of typologyto account for differences in making decisions. e.g. 5 types of farmers: hobby, conventional, diversifier..each groups makes decisions in different ways. But this only answers modellng requirements, not "why" decisions are so made, so idealy you want to ge beyond such heuristics! 
8) evolutionary programming falls under 7 really, but has very specific computational processes, where strategies are computed through genetic programming - these are found to be consistent with meconometric models and rules of thumb solicited from interviews..
9) Assumption and/or calibration based rules. hypothetical rules where inadequate data or theory exists. Often temrporary untested hypothetical ruels are excepted to operationalize the model . Alternatively calubration based rules: various candidate values are applied, this may produce various outcomes. Probelms: you don-t usually have all the possible candidate, calibration is often cited as a weakness of ABM modelling!

CONCLUSION None of these decision models are exclusive. Makes the distinction between empirical based and process based? Should use more process based, but keep it simple stupid (kiss - axelrod 1997)},

abstract = {We present an integrated modeling framework for simulating land-use decision making under the influence of payments for ecosystem services. The model combines agent-based modeling (ABM) with Bayesian belief networks (BBNs) and opinion dynamics models (ODM). The model endows agents with the ability to make land-use decisions at the household and plot levels. The decision-making process is captured with the BBNs that were constructed and calibrated with both qualitative and quantitative information, i.e., knowledge gained from group discussions with stakeholders and empirical survey data. To represent interpersonal interactions within social networks, the decision process is further modulated by the opinion dynamics model. The goals of the model are to improve the ability of ABM to emulate land-use decision making and thus provide a better understanding of the potential impacts of payments for ecosystem services on land use and household livelihoods. Our approach provides three important innovations. First, decision making is represented in a causal directed graph. Second, the model provides a natural framework for combining knowledge from experts and stakeholders with quantitative data. Third, the modular architecture and the software implementation can be customized with modest efforts. The model is therefore a flexible, general platform that can be tailored to other studies by mounting the appropriate case-specific “brain” into the agents. The model was calibrated for the Sloping Land Conversion Program (SLCP) in Yunnan, China using data from participatory mapping, focus group interviews, and a survey of 509 farm households in 17 villages.},

abstract = {Abstract Conventional approaches to natural resource management are increasingly challenged by environmental problems that are embedded in highly complex systems with profound uncertainties. These so-called social-ecological systems (SESs) are characterized by strong links between the social and the ecological system and multiple interactions across spatial and temporal scales. New approaches are needed to manage those tightly coupled systems; however, basic understanding of their nonlinear behavior is still missing. Modeling is a traditional tool in natural resource management to study complex, dynamic systems. There is a long tradition of SES modeling, but the approach is now being more widely recognized in other fields, such as ecological and economic modeling, where issues such as nonlinear ecological dynamics and complex human decision making are receiving more attention. SES modeling is maturing as a discipline in its own right, incorporating ideas from other interdisciplinary fields such as resilience or complex systems research. In this paper, we provide an overview of the emergence and state of the art of this cross-cutting field. Our analysis reveals the substantial potential of SES models to address issues that are of utmost importance for managing complex human-environment relationships, such as: (i) the implications of ecological and social structure for resource management, (ii) uncertainty in natural and social systems and ways to address it, (iii) the role of coevolutionary processes in the dynamics of SESs, and (iv) the implications of microscale human decision making for sustainable resource management and conservation. The complexity of SESs and the lack of a common analytical framework, however, also pose significant challenges for this emerging field. There are clear research needs with respect to: (i) approaches that go beyond rather simple specifications of human decision making, (ii) development of coping strategies to deal with (irreducible) uncertainties, (iii) more explicit modeling of feedbacks between the social and ecological systems, and (iv) a conceptual and methodological framework for analyzing and modeling SESs. We provide ideas for tackling some of these challenges and indicate potential key focal areas for SES modeling in the future.},
annote = {Natural resource management - conventional approaches ignore the complexity and non-linearity of these systems and the interaction between the social and ecological dynamics.221

SES models analyse and simulate possible developmental pathways allowing for i) enhancineg our understanding of the system's behavour and ii)providing management advice and strategies to support hteir inherent uncertainty 222-223

SES is a meregent field without a unifying analytical and methodological framework 225

SES modeling in fisheries, rangelands and wildlife management - resource economics since 1970s, neoclassical economics / maximizing individual or social welfare; full information, rational utility-maximizing agents. Ecological system described simply. Applied ecology on the other hand uses models that focus on the ecological dynamics and human intervention is an external and static pressure. Natural resource economics embody the ideas of fixed carrying capacities (eg. rangelands), steady -state resource dynamics and maximum sustainable yields - ignoring threshold effects, irreversibility of some ecological chanegs, variability and unpredictability eg of rainfall..232
From 1990 nonequilibrium models were being proposed. these models incorporate oportunistc stocking (wtf?). More recently the impact of social, institutional change has also been modeled. But to adequately represent these you need to model the heterogeneity of responses to chanegs in institutional settings - these models do not incorporate realistic social dynaimcs. but see eg. different rationalities for herdsmen-peasant relationships (Rou2001), learning by decision makers (Gross2006), and the role of cooperation in common property regimes.(references in text). 233
Also multiagent models of household livelihoods and vulnerablity under changing social-ecological conditions (africa, central asia, see text for refs.)
Wildlife - individual household utility may contradict maximum sustainable yield - noncompliance of resource users with management rules. . "difefrence in objectives between those that manage and those that exploit natural resources"234

SES modeling in bioeconomics an decological economics. Research mainly focused on fisheries: optimal decision making under risk generated by temporaly variable resource dynamics. "In economics risk is charactarised by knowledge of both the set of possible outcomes and the probality distribution over this set" (cf Knight 1921) NOT the same as uncertainty or ignorance, where the probability distributions are unknown. 235
Ecological economics - science and management of sustainability - differs from resource economics by explicitly considering ethical questions (justice towards future generations) and including more realistic ecological dynamics. Because in resource economics the need for clear cut analytical results has overshadowed the need to realistically represent the complexity of ecological dynamics as this leads to less simplistic management recommendations, but this is slowly changeing. 

SES modeling in resilience and complex systems research
Resilience: "is a perspective for the analysis of SESs that emphasizes their nonlinear dynamics, the existance of thresholds, uncertainty and surprise and feedbacks between social and ecological systems across temporal and spatial scales. (Folke2010) It is the capacity of a SES to absorb shocks, to learn from shocks 236. But despite its emphasis on feedback mechanisms on ly few models so far have truly adressed social-ecological feedbacks in a dynamic way 237. but in recent years SES modeling in resiliance research has increasingly focused on human behavious. e.g. Bodin2005 explore how the intensity of information sharing in a network of resource users in an uncertain environment affects the colapse of a renewabel resource - highliy connected networks increase the likelyhood of a collapse because of syncronised behaviour! (ABM)

Complex Systems theory "a system in which large neworks of components with no central control and simple rules of operations give rise to compelz collective behaviour, sophisticated information processing and adaptation via learning or evolution" (see Macy2002)238
CS research usus bottom up modelling like ABMto generate macro patterns. Aim: detect micro rules that can explain an observable macro pattern. Seminal work Lansing1993 : empirical based ABM to understand the coordination of water management in the rice terraces of Bali. showed how the water temple coevolved with and constrained environmental processes such as crop growth and pest dynamics (!). 
Then some stuff on networks.. social networks, networks involving multiple actors and institutions.. collective-action...

Major crosscutting issues and research questions - they identify 4 main issues:240

i) Implications of complex social and ecological structure for the management of SES On both the ecological and social front, modellers are begining to include more realistic representations of the systems' structures. But this brings about its own problems and challenges: how much detail to include? what is teh aprorpiate level of abstraction, how much variability to include, wht is the system boundary, relevant variables and processes, level of aggregation etc most appropriate. see e.g. "model-to-model analysis. See also some references for developing a common analytical framework for SES.

ii)coping with uncertainty in resource and social dynamics in decision making. - despite uncertainty, information asymetries an d gaps.. policymakers still have to make decisions. i) tools for decision making, the design of incentives and regulatory instrumetns 242. But these tools tend not to consider microlevel human decision making and how they affect the implementation of top down decisions. Another strands look at the implications of subjective perceptions how they affect decision making under uncertainty. cf. Janssen2006. But some models still have irreducible uncertainties and there is still no methodologicallz sound and convincing way to deal with this. carperterh1999 sugests developing strategies to cope with rather than reduce uncertainties. ii) coping with uncertainty- portfolios of coping mechanisms for variability, e.g using traditional knowledge to inform strategies as well (muller2007) iii) social uncertainty - humans don-t behave predictably, 'unexpected responses of humans to management interventions' noncompliance etc may even worsen the situation. e.g. the 'rebound effect' where eg increased efficiency actually leads to lower price and hence increased consumption, and hence larger environmental impact. e.g. milner/gulland "in a terrestrial, subsistence harvesting sys- tem and showed that yield, the performance metric commonly used in most natural resource modeling, does not correlate with performance metrics of benefit to individual resource users (i.e., utility) or to con- servation goals"

iii) coevolutionary processes in SES management feedbacks between socail and ecological processes.Usual way of modellint is with bottom up - individual user utility functions guiding their decisions, adapting to environmental(perceived) change and out of this a system behavious evolves. (miller2007 for coplex adaptive social systems). The challenge is to model people's changing expectations. Also this acknowledges "history" ie path dependence of the system's dynamics - eg different strategies can lead to the same equilibrium levels, but have different levels of resilience in extreme states

iv) understanding macroscale effects of microscale behaviors. The social embededness of individuals - behavior is determined by both agency and structure. Challenges: identification of decision criteria, determining the role of social norms in individual decision making. Also what to use as the explanation of human behaviou - psychological theories, space-based theories, rationa actor theory from economics, ad hoc theories informed by empirical observations. See Schreinmemachers2006 for comparison between heuristic and optimization agents
. More attention has been given to the role of power structures 250 

Improved modeling of SES
i) A common analytical framework Ostrom 2009 framework: resource system/ rsource services and units / ator / governance system / environment 251

ii) protocosl for presenting and communicating SES. ODD protocol - Overview, Design concepts and Details , also extended as TRACE - transparent and comprehensive ecological modeling

iii) explicit consideration of model uncertainty . Parameter uncertainty, (sensitiviy analysis) but thorough exploration of a model is very rare, sometimes impossible. Pattern-oriented modelign techniques? (Grimm2005) 253

Conclusions "When modeling SES one has to accept that there is no single correct or best model for a given problem setting. Instead SES modelers ahve to rely on suites of models that offer diferent perspectives and insights into a complex problem. 255
But e.g. ABM models have mostly been applied to address theoretical issues, providing a 'proof of concept' rather than solutions to empirically measurabel phenomena (Janssen 2006). Beter linkage to real-world problems can be achieved by i) parameterizing models with empirical data, ii) comparing results with observed empirical patterns, iii) integrating models with empirical research and management in an adaptive manner. Also iv) better validation. 256

annote = {(intro by editor) First, more prevalant approach to studying social behaviour is to collect data, analyse them and possibly estimate a model. Second, rarer is to start with a theoretical understanding of a behavoirs, build a model of it, then simulate its dynamics to gain a better understanding of its complexity. 


Origin of ABm is often attributed to Von Neumann, who developped the von neumann machines - not really ABMs or even models at all, but theoretical constructs that paved the way to modelling artificial life.



Preface:
"ABM is particularly suited for topics where undersanding processes and their consequences is important" "stands beside mathematical and statistical modelling in terms of its rigour. Like equation based modelling, but unlike prose, abms have to be complete, consistent and unambiguous if they are to be capable of being executed on a computer. ... unlike most mathematical models, thez can include agents that are heterogenous, in their features and abilities, can model situations that are far from equilibrium and ca deal directly with the consequences of interactions between agents. "



1. The idea of agent based modelling. 

"In comparison to variable based approaches using structural equations or system based approaches using differential equations , abm offers the possibility of modelling individual heterogeneity, representing explicitly agents decision rules and situating agents in a geographical or other type of space."
- a computational method - a model formulated as a computer programme, representing the processes that are thought to exist in the real world. 
- enables a researcher to experiment - usually impossible or undesirable in social sciences. But with an virtual population you can, you can reapeat them a number of times, vary parameters etc. 
- using models / intended to represent a target, a real existing phenomenon. i) scale models / reduced siye and level of detail or complexity. ii) an ideal tipe model, some characteristics are exaggerated in order to simplify the model. eg drivers that never get lost, or instantaneous flow of information. iii) analogical models, analogy to some better understood phenomenon (computer model of the brain). These three are not mutually exclusive. iv) mathematical or equation based models. Here there is no implication of analogy or resemblance between the model and the target. We're only interested in model fit, the equation is derived from statistical data, not from any theorizing about the real world. They can clarify relationships between variables but are not very useful in helping us understand the WHY, the mechanisms and processes that connect them. 
- the models are composed of agents - represent social actors. they interact with their environment and crucially also with eachother. 
- in an environment - can be quite neturla or very detailed. COmmonly represents a geographical space - ie they are spatially explicit. But htis space can also bee e.g a knwoledge space or a social network. 


1.2.7. "Agent based models have been used with success in rural areas in third world countires to help with the management of scarce natural resources such as water for irrigation. This surprising use of agent-based models is due to their fit with participative or participatory research methods." In addition to research, also support for decision making and traintitn e.g. also called companion modelling, "invovles building a multi agent model in close association with informants selected from people on the ground. As a prelimnary, the informants may be interviewed about their understanding of the situation and they then engage in a role/plazing game. Eventually, when sufficient knowledge has been gained, a computer model is created and used with the participatns as a training aid or as a negotiating support, allowint the answering of what if questins a. 
Bareteau et al 2001 Senegal River Valey. to understand why an irrigation scheme there produced disappointing results. In this example the ABM was developped first and the ints main elements converted to an RPG, partly to validate the ABM and partlz because RPG is easier to use in a rural environment. 


1.3 The features of agent based modelling
- ontological correspondence - "there can be a direct correspondence between computational agents in the model and real-world actors.
- heterogenous agents generally models tend to deal with typical or representative agents. Sometimes thay may have different preferences, but not different rules of bahaviour, which is possible and analytically solvable in computational models. 
- represnetation of the environment - a direct representation of it: physical aspects of it, the effects of other agents nearby...
- agent interactions - simplest is just the information that another agent is close by, but of course the data transferred can be complicated and language based, with noise and misunderstandings..
- bounded rationality - Herbert SImon 1957 hyperrationality and models that have people follow long complex chanis of thought areh not realistic, rather bounded rationality is, limited informaiton, limited cognitive ability, limited ability to optimize their utility. 
- learning - abms are able to simulate it at both individual and population levels. i( individuals can learn from their own experience, ii) evolutionary learning hwere populations learn because stupid agetns die and are replaced by better agents so the population is better on average, iii)social learning: agents are thaught from others - imitation



Comparison to microsimulation: starts with large database describing a sample of individuals, at a certain point in time. Updates the population based on some transition probabilities, and then at the end of the simulation period calculates the aggregate statistics. Commonly used to assess distributional imiplications of policy e.g. pension reform etc. Potentially quite a lot of data are needed to get the whole matrix of conditional probabilities (e.g p of 35 year old low education women of becoming unemployed). Then there is the problem, that all individuals are threated as isolated. , so there is no interaction, typically also no notion of space or geography..



comparison to system dynamics "one creates a model that expresses the temporal cause-effect relationships between variables, but agents are not represented directly" it is capable of handling direct causal links and feedback loops. It is based on "the evaluation of sets of simultaneous differential equations, each calculates the value of a variable at the next time step given values of the others at the current time step"Deals with aggregate, not individual agents, so heterogeneity is difficult to account for. 


AGENTS
(Woolridge and Jennings 1995) have four features: 
- Autonomy - no global controller
- social ability
- reactivity
-proactivity - has goals it pursues od its own initiative
But this is not very helpful in designing agents (too abstract?) so instead we can describe them as having:
- perception : of their environment, other agents in the vicinity
- performance: set of behaviours, often including motion, communication and action. 
- memory : records theri perceptions of their previous states and actions
- policy: a set of rules, heuristics or strategies, that determine, given their present situation and their history, what behaviours they will carry out. 
So how to implemetn this?
1. Ad hoc programming {\textgreater} object oriented naturally
2. Production rule systems{\textgreater} set of rules{\&} a working memory {\&} a rule interpreter {\&} and input and an outoput process
3. Neural Networs... are more flexible and can develop behaviours the researcher has not considered, but once it's been trained it's almost impossible to discover how it works, you just have a matrix of connection weights, no comprehensibel explanation for its behaviour. 


ENVIROMENTS 
As a channel of communication (the environment can aslo act as a buffer for the messages, so they can all get the info at once), passive nonreactive objects such as barriers, roads, links, need no capacity to interact with their surroundings. 


RANDOMNESS "one way of abstracting from the complexity of the real world when designing a model is to build in some randomness. " to develop a more general model. 


TIME time is modelled in discrete steps. issues
- syncronicity. only one thing can happen at once. zou can i) invoke each agent in sequential order, generally a bad idea. ii) random asynchronous execution - a different random order at each step. iii) invoke in whatever order and buffer all interactions until all are done before you run them through - simulated synchronous executione. 
- event driven simulation. so this assumed that everyone gets to do something at each step. but that is not necessary, another approach is event driven design, in which only some agents are invoked. Instead of a timestep of constant duration, the simulation skips from one event to another
- calibrating time{\textgreater} so what if your model says that sth happened after 50 ticks on average, how much is that in real time?


3. Using agent based models
- research question. sth you have a realistic chance of answering, better err on side of specificity than generality. 
Now most of the models mentioned start from an observed regularity and try to explain how it comes about. e.g. ethnical segregation. or some other stylized fact. 
-specify the agents to be involved. for each agent type lay out their rules of behaviour. Two lists, one that shows how the environment (incl other agents) can affect the agent and one on how the agent can affect the environment (including other agents), and the conditions that invoke these behaviours
- then figure out what the environment should be like, do agents need a specific location, or netework connections or what?
- then develop the code
- then the long process of debugging or verification to make sure it does what it was intended to do
- then validation: does the model exhibit the macro level regularities we are seeking to explain. But even so, be careful because alternative explanations may be equally plausible. so
- sensitivity analysis, to see if different parameters or agent bahaviours lead to the same results. 
- then compare the output of the model to observed empirical data. Which can be tricky, especially since most models are stochastic, so random chance affects the output. And is different deprnding on whether you-ve got abstract models , middle range models, you kind of have to rely more on qualitative similarities rather than quantitative ones. or if you have a facsimile model, that aims to reproduce exactly some sort of behaviour, but such models are rare in social sciences, because ofthe element of randomness both in the simulation as well as in the real world


-validation 1: comparing theory and the model. "derive a number of propositions about the form of the relationship expected, and then check if the expected distributions do in face appear when the model is run using a variety of parameter settings"
-validation 2: comparing the model and empirical data, only really if you've got a facsimile model, measure fit

abstract = {Individual-based models (IBMs) have long been proposed as a key tool for understanding and predicting ecosystem complexities, yet the contribution of this approach to basic or applied ecology has been less than anticipated. Fundamental reasons for the disappointing contribution of IBMs have been, in the current absence of a theoretical foundation for IBMs, conceptual flaws in model formulation and the failure to address critical computer implementation issues. Researchers in the new field of Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) study how complex behaviors emerge in systems of relatively simple interacting individuals. Research on CAS, while still new and informal, has identified key concepts for making individual-based systems realistic. I propose that explicit consideration of the following concepts from CAS should make the design of IBMs less ad hoc and more likely to produce models of value for basic and applied ecology: (1) Emergence: what behaviors and population dynamics should emerge from the model's mechanistic representation of key processes vs. being imposed on the model as empirical relations? How should individual traits be modeled so that realistic population responses emerge?; (2) Adaptation: given the model's temporal and spatial scales, what adaptive processes of individuals should be modeled? What mechanisms do individuals use to adapt in response to what environmental forces?; (3) Fitness and strategy: what measures of fitness are appropriate to use as the basis for modelling decision making? Should fitness measures change with life history state?; (4) State-based responses: how should decision processes depend on an individual's state?; (5) Prediction: anticipating decision outcomes appears essential for modelling many behaviors; what are realistic assumptions about how organisms predict the consequences of decisions?; (6) Computer implementation: what user interfaces are necessary to make the model, and especially individual behaviors, observable and testable? How will the model's full design and computer implementation be documented and tested so results are reproducible and valid?},

abstract = {Outlines five difficulties with modelling demographic behaviour using agent based modelling with particular reference to the role of social interactions in the difussion of new contraceptive practices. The first difficulty is the potentially thin character of information and activities relevant to contraception within the wider framework of social action. The second difficulty is ensuring the correct relaitonship betwee ABM and existing theories, either based on aggregate statistical patterns or strong homogeneity assumption about individuals. The third difficulty is ensuring adequate representation of the contextual nature of social action, both in time and space. The fourth difficulty is to represent the complexity of decision processes adequately so tehy can take account of the transmission of different kinds of information: norms, costs and benefits, practices and so on. The final difficulty is the possibility of collecting relevant data for building and testing ABMs. The chapter also draws attention to the connections between these difficulties and suggests solutions where these exist. In some cases like the modelling of thin processes and cognitive complexity, considering social behaviour from an ABM perspective reveals important challenges fro social science research that are obscured by other approaches to modelling.},
address = {Heidelberg},
annote = {So the running example is the role of social interaction in changing contraceptive practices - extensively discussesd problem but with no consensus (approaches range from rational choice, adaptive behaviour, social networks, innovation diffusion and development theory) 


One common approach in social sciences is to model only a specific aspect of social behavoiur and disregard other aspects of social action. eg the effect of divorce on children's attitude to having kids. This takes a very static view of cause and effect. So eg there is a direct and fixed effect of divorce on attitudes abotu having kids. Abbot criticizes this view as "general linear reality" because assumptions that are made for statistical reasons are backed onto human behavoiur in an empirically implausible way. 
In the other hand you have a dynamic conception of social reality in which all events in the socail world have consequences that in turn have other consequences etc.There is room for contingency and uniqueness in these event chains. This is where ABM is particularly suited for.


In the example of contraception only a very small proportion of social interaction is directly causaly rellevant to innovation decisions. But a much larger proportion of interactions are indirectly relevant: they still need to be modelled to understand the actual temporal and spatial patterns of diffusion and behaviour change. So in traditional models the idea is that network connectivity does not directly cause contraception decisions, so it can be held static, or abstracted out.


"Unlike statistical approaches, ABM requires us to distinguish between causal factors in social action and what might be called "structuring factors". These structuring factors are the patterns of social action that define such overall societal properties such as "viscosity" (how long things take to happen) , sociability (how many people are typically involved) and so on. " Anyway, so for thin social behaviour modelling first of all you need to recognize it. Then ideally you habe a generic model of social structure, that includes realistic social encounters and activities..},

Based on agent-based modeling methodologies, MABEL presents a bottom-up approach to allow the analysis of dynamic features and relations among geographic, environmental, human, and socioeconomic attributes of landowners, as well as comprehensive relational schematics of land-use change. The authors adopt a distributed modeling architecture (DMA) in MABEL to separate the modeling of agent behaviors in Bayesian belief networks from task-specific simulation scenarios.Through a client-server infrastructure, MABEL provides an efficient and scalable decision request-response mechanism among heterogeneous agents, scenarios, and behavioral models. As an important part of the land-use change model, a market-bidding system and an adaptive land partition algorithm for land transactions are also discussed.},

abstract = {While many models have investigated the role of competitive mate selection processes in human marriage, few have addressed the potential for assortative processes to explain the observed demographics, as well as simultaneously investigating divorce.  To explore the possibility that assortative mate selection processes may explain patterns of both marriage and divorce, we developed an agent-based model, MADAM (Marriage and Divorce Annealing Model), based on homophilic trait matching, in which individuals search for mates similar to themselves, but relax these expectations as they age. MADAM assumes individuals live in a world with N mate-relevant traits, where each individual chooses a set of k traits from those N to represent his or her identity.  Individuals seek marriage partners with some number of identical traits, but over time relax their expectations for this desired threshold number of matching traits.  Divorce is allowed when individuals find a partner who shares more traits with them than their current partner.  With this implementation, we explored how population heterogeneity and individual differences affect population-level demographic trends, finding that increasing population heterogeneity and a reduction in the rate of relaxing expectations can both increase the mean age at first marriage.  MADAM also accurately predicts demographic marriage and divorce data across cultures, with quantitatively accurate predictions for length of first marriage, likelihood of first marriage ending in divorce, and percent of population married by the end of the lifespan.},

Modern technologies in the fields of GIS and data processing, together with an increasing amount of accessible information, have the potential to meet the varying information needs of policymakers and stakeholders. Multiagent modeling holds the promise of providing an enhanced collaborative framework in which planners, modelers, and stakeholders may learn and interact. The fulfillment of this promise, however, depends on the empirical parameterization of multiagent models. Although multiagent models have been widely applied in experimental and hypothetical settings, only few studies have strong linkages to empirical data and the literature on methods of empirical parameterization is still limited. This paper presents a straightforward approach to parameterize multiagent models in applied development research. The parameterization uses a common sampling frame to randomly select observation units for both biophysical measurements and socioeconomic surveys. The biophysical measurements, i.e., soil properties in this study, are then extrapolated over the landscape using multiple regressions and a digital elevation model. The socioeconomic surveys are used to estimate probability functions for key characteristics of human actors, which are then assigned to the model agents with Monte Carlo techniques. This approach generates a landscape and agent populations that are robust and statistically consistent with empirical observations.},

- what is missing is a higher level synthesis with in a broader agent/based, multi/level, multi/state framefork.
- Demography - different levels individual, household, population, geography; increased dimensionality of problems and data requirements, increase predictive uncertainty..
- ABMs "can address phenomena for which there is no explicit analytical representaiton." they can explain non-linear phenomena, complex interactions etc. which are a problem for statistical demography, where even micro-simulation finds it difficult to allow such complexities. 

-model-based science "models as valid tools of theory generation". ABMs as a tool to ge neyond explanation and prediction, but e.g the flexibility to understand how micro interactions cause macro effects. .
- in Billari et al 2003 ABCD is viewed as a paradigm where "the simulation is used first of all to develop and explore theories rather than to evaluate empirically the consequences of given rates/probabilities"
- demography is traditionaly concerned with prediction, AMBs are more ofthe used to provide explanations. 
- multi-level microsimulation in demography increasingly popular, but fails to capture feedback effeccts, social interactions, formation of social networks etc.
- Statistical individuals based on observations, censuses, surveys.. vs. simulated individuals agents equiped wth some rules governing their behaviour. Some links between the two approaches already exist. eg.. simple rules of behaviour in microsimulation models etc. 
- ABMs augmented wiht statistical infornmation allow investigation over longer time horizons, linkages between micro and macro levels allows the study of complex behaviour in artificial populations with real-world characteristics. To allwo theoretica exploration and scenario generation.



The Wedding ring - a proof-of-concept agent-based model incorporating more traditional statistical demographic methods. Original WR model on partnership formation and peer influence or pressure. The social pressure is modelled as a sigmoid function, governed by two parameters. 
- there are five types of agents depednign on who is teh main influence on them - only or mostly orlder, only or mostly younger or both. 

The wedding doughnut - two dimensional toroidal shape. Then changes to the demographics: mortality added from onserved and forcasted death rates based on empirical data dromthe Human mortality database, fertility patterns taken from ONS and eurostat, for future years the rates are predicted using a bi-linear demographic model , initial population age and sex and marital structure from teh 1951 census. Not restricting partnership to legal marriage, but did not include single parents. Also included health status model - ill health status, probability increases with age
- if a partnership is formed they move together to somewhere in between, depending on the size of their social networks. Children are also placed there. There is no divorce though. So birth, location, partnership(if) , children, ill-health, death are followed through, step by step. 

Results - 250 runs of the simulation, 300 years, smoothed out. Population pyramid comparisson 2011 pretty cool given that migration was not taken into acount. Sensitivity analysis. comparing hazard functions for partnership formation under different assumptions suggest a high sensitivity to parametrisation of the model
Example 2 - exploring the parameter space in ABM - following the ideas of the MUCM project (managing uncertainty in complex models). Using the emulator and a parameter space (!?) they can find which components are most important, how important their interaction is etc. to the variability of the output variable. . 
This allows a thorough exploration of the parameter space in teh context of various policy goals and constraints. A natural extension (not attempted here) would be " a full, stakeholder driven decision analysis". 
This approach allows for overcoming dava -related limitations augmenting available statistical information with assumptions on behavioral rules. The price is "departing from the entirely data-driven paradigm".

This is clearly a positive development, but in far too many cases stakeholders have merely been paid lip service and their engagement has consequentially been quite nominal. Nevertheless, it is generally agreed that better decisions are implemented with less conflict and more success when they are driven by stakeholders, that is by those who will be bearing their consequences. Participatory modelling, with its various types and clones, has emerged as a powerful tool that can (a) enhance the stakeholders knowledge and understanding of a system and its dynamics under various conditions, as in collaborative learning, and (b) identify and clarify the impacts of solutions to a given problem, usually related to supporting decision making, policy, regulation or management. In this overview paper we first look at the different types of stakeholder modelling, and compare participatory modelling to other frameworks that involve stakeholder participation. Based on that and on the experience of the projects reported in this issue and elsewhere, we draw some lessons and generalisations. We conclude with an outline of some future directions.},

This paper uses Bayesian belief networks (BBN) to incorporate characteristics of land managers in the modeling process and to enhance our understanding of land-use change based on the limited and disparate sources of information. One of the two models based on spatial data represented land managers in the form of a quantitative variable, the area of individual holdings, whereas the other model included qualitative data from a survey of land managers. Random samples from the spatial data provided evidence of the relationship between the different variables, which I used to develop the BBN structure. The model was tested for four different posterior probability distributions, and results showed that the trained and learned models are better at predicting land use than the uniform and random models. The inference from the model demonstrated the constraints that biophysical characteristics impose on land managers; for older land managers without heirs, there is a higher probability of the land use being arable agriculture. The results show the benefits of incorporating a more complex notion of land managers in land-use models, and of using different empirical data sources in the modeling process. Future research should focus on incorporating more complex social processes into the modeling structure, as well as incorporating spatio- temporal dynamics in a BBN.},

abstract = {The psychological prolem of uncovering the mechanisms by which people select mates or marriage partners and the demographic problem of understanding the emergence of population -level patterns of marriage can be brought together to illuminate each other. In this paper we combine a top-down demographic approach with a bottom-up psychological approach to study marriage and mate search via agent-based simulations. We model a group of agents searching for mates using individual aspiration-based satisficing heuristics, which are simple, psychologically plausible mechanisms suggested by the framework of bounded rationality. By comparing the resulting population-level patterns with the general features of demographically observed age-at-marriage distributions we find that the psychological mechanisms must be refined to account for the empirical data. In particular we show the importance of heterogeneity across individuals for producing realistic marriage times.},
address = {Heidelberg},
annote = {Traditional demographic research analyses aggregate population-level data such as age at marriage or proportion ever married, but this obscures the individual decision making process. Psychologists or economists on the other hand tend to look at individual level processes that lead to the decision to marry. 
To bridge the two approaches to the study of the marriage market an ABM is developed to simulate the mate search. This way they can model the micro-level decisions and observe the patterns that emerge at the macro level as a consequence. 
2. exisitng explanations for common invariant features of age at marriage patterns. relatively stable across places and historical periods, unimodal with long tail to right. The Coale and McNeil model uses Sweden as areference distribution and models others using only three parameters: i) proportion eventually married, ii) mean age at first marriage iii) variance of age distribution at first marriage. Their behavioural interpretation of the model is that first marriage is "stochasticaly determined by the transition through a sequence of latent stages inyoung adulthood" starting out as non marriagable, adn then enter a marriagable state. 


From the behavioral point of view it is more suitable to look at the hazard rate of marriage: the probability of marriage during the next interval (or density if continuous) given that one has not married at a particular exact age. this first increases, then decreases slowly. If this speed is high enough this implies a proportion will never marry. Hazard rates are better since they are not influenced by the probability of surviving.


Three main types of models have been proposed to explain the unimodal hazard rate with slow descent.
i)latent state modes : Coale and McNeil{\textgreater} the age of entry is normally distributed and there are subsequent exponentially distributed delays before marriage. model fits complete cohort data well, but is less good for forecasting cohort behaviour by extrapolation. 
ii) difussion models - mating happens by contagion. Hernes. pressure increases with age, which reduces threshold value of acceptable partner. but also your marriagebility reduces with age
iii) search models - agents act according to some search mechanism in a reasonable (optimal?) manner. 


Sequential search process
- grow up until you are marriagable 
- start looking for partner
- marry or just age and keep looking
there are only first marriages in this model, we record first ages at marriage and proportion unmarried and compare with observed data. 


Environment: does the agent see all potential mates at the same time and choose the most appropriate one. But this implies complete knowledge which is unrealistic except for small societies. Instead more realistic is sequential meeting, no or little recall (you can't go back) you just have to decide when to stop searching. 
So when to stop? You can accumulate as much information as possible and then calculate the optimum strategy, but this would require a lot of computing capabilities. But real agents have to employ simple mechanisms in finite time. So they act according to "what Herbert Simon called bounded rather than unbounded rationality - making decisions withing the bounds of time, information and computational ability imposed by the task evironment and human cognitive capacities"
This is not necesarrily irrational though - according to Gigerenzer in properly structured environments this behaviour can yield good results - ecological rationality - so the structure of the environemt allows limited humans to nevertheless make good decisions without too much time, information or computation. Using heuristics


So what is a reasonable stopping rule for the marriage model? SImon proposes a satisficing model, where successive alernatives are checked until one is "good enough" - instead of optimal. 


1 One-sided search process. starting point, although clearly unrealistic in most cultures. Analogosus to the dowry problem, where it turns out the searcher should go through 37{\%} of the women, set his aspiration level to the highest and then take the first one after that that is above his aspiration level. But this is a long search process and low success rate, not very close to human mate search process!. But if you relax the assumptions and are happy with someone in the top 25 {\%} then it is enough to only look at 12 people or so to determine your aspiration level . 


So Billari 2000 simulated this "fast and frugal" heuristic to see if it produces correct nuptuality patterns. But this produces a monotonically falling distribution! But this was easily fixed by adding heterogeneity to the aspiration level determination: instead of looking at 12 and then deciding, each agent had a different number.
So a simple rule exhibits bounded (ecological) rationality by making a relatively good choice in a short amount of time AND reproduces the important characteristics of the age at marriage distribution. 


2. Two sided search process. In the more realistic case of competitive searching the previous heuristic doesn't work so well - if everyone sets their aspiration level based on the highest mate they have seen in the first 12 or so, they will mostly end up with too high aspiration levels, so most would end up alone. 
Model one is where agents don't know their own value and make practice offers during an "adolescence period" , and based on that adjusts its aspiration level. After this period the real offers begin.
If agents know their own level *from the start) and use it as the aspiration level, you get the exponentially decreasing curve..But if they haev a varying length of adolescence *no learning), then you get the familiar unimodal distribution. 


So a more complex learning rule takes into account all the information from the adoleschence learnign period: who made offers and what their level was. SO raising ones aspiration with high value proposals and vice versa. So again, if you make the adolescent times normallly varying, you get a nice curve. 


So it wasnt going from single sided to two sided search. Or going from knowing your value to learning it that created the right distribution. It was adding heterogeneity. 


In the end of course opened up more questions than answered},

abstract = {This paper proposes a review of the development and use of multi-agent simulations (MAS) for ecosystem management. The use of this methodology and the associated tools accompanies the shifts in various paradigms on the study of ecological complexity. Behavior and interactions are now key issues for understanding and modeling ecosystem organization, and models are used in a constructivist way. MAS are introduced conceptually and are compared with individual-based modeling approaches. Various architectures of agents are presented, the role of the environment is emphasized and some computer tools are presented. A discussion follows on the use of MAS for ecosystem management. The strength of MAS has been discussed for social sciences and for spatial issues such as land-use change. We argue here that MAS are useful for problems integrating social and spatial aspects. Then we discuss how MAS can be used for several purposes, from theorization to collective decision-making support. We propose some research perspectives on individual decision making processes, institutions, scales, the credibility of models and the use of MAS. In conclusion we argue that researchers in the field of ecosystem management can use multi-agent systems to go beyond the role of the individual and to study more deeply and more effectively the different forms of organization (spatial, networks, hierarchies) and interactions among different organizational levels. For that objective there is considerably more fruit to be had on the tree of collaboration between social, ecological, and computer scientists than has so far been harvested.},

ComMod - Multi-agent-Systems to integrate various stakeholders' points of view and use tehm within platforms of collective learning. 


Modelling the "interactions between social and ecological dynamics", going "beyond disciplinary apporaches" that either 
- look at an ecological system subject to antrhopological disturbance - ecological approach 
- a nsocial system subject to natural constraints. - social dynamics or economic approach
both hypothesise "equilibrium and optimization to formalize situations of competition and interaction"
But these guys wanna looka th the dynamics and interacitons of both and look at the decision making process as the main research theme. not a rational calculation of a more or less informed decision maker, but a process of interactions between stakeholders with various objectives, perceptions, levels of information and varying degrees of importance and influence. 
"The choice was made to use MAS"
This involved developing a companion modelling aporach methodologaz" for the use of MAS tools within the community of approaches dealing with participatory modelling for colelctive learning and action. Com Mod uses RPG to aquire knowledge, build MAS models and validate them and use them in the decision making process dealing with collective resource management."



Principles and objective of the companion modelling approach; the researcher is not the one with an objective view of the world, but in addition to taking the decision maker into account, but also the other heterogenous actors involved in the management of the ecosystem, all of teh views of which haev to be compared, and assessed.. 
Inspiration for Com Mod comes from:
- adaptive management: the recognition that ecossystem mamagement requires "flexible, diverse, redundant regulation and monitoring that lead to corective responses and.." developed by ecologists, but recognises adaptive management depends on the generation and exchange of knowledge.. so interaction and exchange of knowledge with stakeholders is required
- co-management: partnership in which local communities, resource users, government agencies and non-government organiyations.. share authority and responsibility over the management 
- patrimonial mediation; "all the material and nonmaterial elements that work together to maintain and develop the identity and autonomy of their holder in time and space through adaptation in a changing environment." so links past, present and futuregenerations of managers... 


So computer modelling as a "tool for interactive learning" - not using simulation for prediction, because tghe "very long term of complex systems cannot be predicted" but what are possible or impossible pathways and scenarios. 


MAS models are used to increase scientific knowledge about the ecological and social processes at stake, they serve to create a collective representation , this is a prerequisite to simulating various scenarios. Com Mod therefore is about full participation of stakeholders in the modelling of all teh points of view, to facilitate dialogue, shared learning and colelctive decision making through interdisciplinary and implicated action oriented research to strengthen the adaptive managemnet capacity of local communities"


use of MAS for Com Mod: common representatin of the research object: 
ComMod: diffferent representations of the systems, different status in management, MAS; Hheterogenous agents. in bothe they interact to transform tehir common environment.},

abstract = {Attempts to quantify the numbers of migrants generated by changes in climate have commonly been calculated by projecting physical climate changes on an exposed population. These studies generally make simplistic assumptions about the response of an individual to variations in climate. However, empirical evidence of environmentally induced migration does not support such a structural approach and recognises that migration decisions are usually both multi-causal and shaped through individual agency. As such, agent-based modelling offers a robust method to simulate the autonomous decision making process relating to environmental migration. The Theory of Planned Behaviour provides a basis that can be used to effectively break down the reasoning process relating to the development of a behavioural intention. By developing an agent-based model of environmental migration for Burkina Faso from the basis of a combination of such theoretical developments and data analysis we further investigate the role of the environment in the decision to migrate using scenarios of future demographic, economic, social, political, and climate change in a dryland context. We find that in terms of climate change, it can be seen that that change to a drier environment produces the largest total and international migration fluxes when combined with changes to inclusive and connected social and political governance. While the lowest international migration flows are produced under a wetter climate with exclusive and diverse governance scenarios. In summary this paper illustrates how agent-based models incorporating the Theory of Planned Behaviour can be used to project evidence based future changes in migration in response to future demographic, economic social and climate change.},

A diagram with boxes and arrows can be easily interpreted, discussed and validated on a step by step basis by the stakeholders: there si no black box effect in the modelling process.

BBN "especially suited for modelling uncertain knowledge"
model construction: two basic approaches: manual model building vased purely on human expert knowledge or automatic learning of the structure and the numerical parameters from the data. and of course the hybrid approach. 
Domain experts: a knowledge engineer focussed on refining the model and preparing questions for the expert. "it helps when the knowledge engineer understands the domain at least at a basic level"
Building the graphical structure of the model: the elicitation of the liver model structure took approx 50 hours of interviews with experts
- selecting variables and their domains ie data reduction. especially feature selection and discretisation of continuous variables
- clarity test - make sure all variables are clearly defined! also make sure the whole process is well documented, you can comment all nodes, arcs, node states and even node probabilities. all the simplifying assumptions made in teh process... 

Elicitation of numerical parameters of the model
"existing datasets of cases can significanlty reduce the knowledge engineering effort required to parametrize BN" when a dataset is small, many conditioning cases are represented by to few or no data records and they do not offer a sufficient basis for learning conditional probability distributions. In such cases the usual assumtion made in learnign parameters is that the distribution is uniform.

abstract = {The study of how people acquire and diffuse information among heterogeneous populations has a rich history in the social sciences. However, few approaches have been developed to better understand how information diffusion patterns and processes affect resource management in complex socio-ecological systems. This is a timely issue for crop protection diffusion programs, which have a larger place than ever on the international policy agenda due to the growing number of challenges related to controlling agricultural pests. To assess the impact of heterogeneous farmer behaviors (receptivity toward IPM practices) and types of information diffusion (either active or passive) on the success of integrated pest management (IPM) programs, we developed a socio-ecological model coupling a pest model (population growth and dispersion) with a farmer behavioral model (pest control and diffusion of pest management practices). The main objective of the model was to provide insights to explore effective IPM information diffusion strategies at the farmer community level. Our simulations revealed 1) that passive IPM information diffusion among agents seemed to be more effective to control pests over the community of agents than active diffusion and 2) that increasing levels of agent heterogeneity would significantly slow down pest control dynamics at the community level, but to a lower extent in the case of passive IPM information diffusion. Our findings therefore suggest that IPM diffusion programs should focus their efforts in developing methods to create purposefully the conditions for social learning as a deliberate pest control mechanism, while taking into account potential limitations related to the commonly reported farmer heterogeneity. Our study further stresses the need to develop a comprehensive and empirically based framework for linking the social and ecological disciplines across space and time in agricultural system management. While we specifically focus on pest infestation levels and IPM information diffusion strategies in this study, our approach to understand information diffusion within heterogeneous human populations in interaction with environmental features would be applicable to a much wider range of both social and resource management issues.},

Controlled experimentation in social sciences: how do you test hypothesis: if individuals behave in a certain way, how will it affect society as a whole?


Nice brief explanation of agent absed models: agents, environment and rules.


Sugarscape model (exploratory laboratory type of model) with very simple rules you already observe macro characteristics found in actual human societies: e.g. you introduce seasons and migration happens. also the sugar accumulation gives rise to a wealth distribution that is often highly skeewd; "the first instance of a qualitative similarity between extant human societies and artificial society on teh sugarscape". then you can experiment, try changing the rules to ses just how imutable this "law" of inequity


trading with sugar and spice, market clearing price based on local decentralized interactions. carring capacity is increased if agents trade, buut this comes at a price of societal inequality. instead of having fixed prefeernces they can also make them change in line with the cultural exchange process


Artificial socieies vs traditional models: 
- heterogenous agent populations. no aggregation, distinct and unique agents, that can also change - adapt( as a result of interractions withother agents and the environment)
- spatial component, completely distinct from the agents
- agent-agent and agent-environmetn interactions based on simple rules. no agent has global information
- focus on dynamics: not on the static equilibria tha may or may not emerge. the out of equilibrium dynamics are much more interesting. 
- beyond mehodological individualism, because although the starting point is the individual then certain social collective structures - "institutions" that emerge can have feedback effects on the individuals 


"social science that embeds evolutionary processes in a computational environment that simulates demographics, the transmission of culture, conflict, economics, disease, the emergence of groups and agent coadaptation with an environemnt, all from teh bottom up. "

Alternatives for LUCC modelling 

- mathematical equation based models - seek some static or equilibrium solution. Because a mumerical or analytica solution must be obtained, this limits the level of cmplexity that can practically be included in teh models.They require simplifying assumptions to achieve tractability, can often be based on implausible assumptions regarding static market equilibria. 
- system models: stocks and flows are represented as sets of linked differential equations interactions have to be explicitly enumerated and spatial relationships are even more difficult to include. Operate at a very aggregate level / or a very coarse temporal and spatial resolution- iei cannot handle local heterogeneity and interactions. 
- statitical techinques: spacial regressions and other spatial statistical methids, but difficult to integrate decision making and other social phenomena. Also the parameter estimates are averages over time, so they are only useful for processes that are uniform over space and time. While various different hierarchical spatial scales can be modelled, you cannot include feedbacs across scales
- expert models: combine expert judgement with probability techniques to allow the quantification of qualitative knowledge
- evolutionalry models: neural netwoksr and evolutionary programming..
- cellular models. include CA and Markov model, "operate over a lattice of congruent cells" the state of the cells depends either deterministically or probabilistically on transition rules, local neighbourhood states or lagegd cell state values. Agents are normally tied to cells, but decision making strategies are fixed, agents heterogeneity and networking are not part of generic CCS
- hybrid models , logical precursors to MAS/LUCC

- ABM: focus on human actiosn. Agents are autonous, share an environment through communication and interaction, make decisions that tie behaviour to the environment. 
- Autonomy: control over their action (Wooldridge:) agents can act flexibly, are goal oriented and capable of interactions with tehir environment (including other agents). 
- cognition is the basis for link between the goals and the environment as expressed by their behaviour: it may be a simple stimuli-response decision making principle, or a proactive principle, taking initiative etc. One of hte most developed principles is rational coice theory, where agents are rational optimizers, but the axiomatic foundations of the theory are empiricaly contested. This has lead to models of bounded raionality. "Rather than implenmenting an optimal solution that fully anticipates all future states of the system of which they are part, they make inductive, discrete and evolving choices that move them toward achieving their goals" 
Bounded rational decision making has been modelled using genetic algorithms, heuristics, simulated annealing, classifier systems and reinforcement learning. 
- complexity theory, not systems research! complexity is characterised by nonlinear relationships between changing entities (not staticentities and linear relationships), focuses on the qualititative attributes sucha s learning and communication , and behaviours emerging from interactions, not stocks and equilibrium between fixed elements. Complexity (and ABM) relies on emergent and synergistic characteristics, which can be understood by examining the subcomponent relationships. And it takes advantage of tools that allow exploratory simulation - explioration of stystem outcomes that are not preordaiend and deterministic.

Why use MAS/LUCC

In a comprehensive review of agent based modelling in spatial applications, list a variety of alternative approaches and their limitations. The crucial finding is that none of the methods is capable of incorporating "the impacts of autonous, heterogenous and decentralized hunam decision making" 
MAS/LUCC can potentially ovvercome these limitations, represent socioeconomic and biophysical complexity, might be suited for modelling the interactions between and feedbacks between them



MASLUCC as a Simulated social laboratory
flexibility of the models- once the model is programmed, you have the flexibility to design and execute experiments to explore alternative mechanisms and scenarios. flexibility of represenation and implementation makes them well suited for alternative scenario analysis



Representing Complexity. "dynamic systems that exhibit recognizable patterns of organization across spatial and temporal scales" Characterised by "interdepende ncies, heterogeniety and nested hierarchies among agents and their environment. In LUCC these three causes of complexity arise from both human decision making and the explicitly spatial aspect of the landscape environment. i) interdependencies among agents, between agents anad their environment, across time and across space. So temporal interdependecies (past decisoins eg), spacial interdependencies determin eg informaiton flow, social networks. Also between agents and their biophysical environment. ii) heterogeneity across agents, across the environmet, space and time. Differenta attributes of agents: experience, values, ability, resources. This may change through time, learning, demographic changes. 
! interdependencies and heterogeneity may lead in a complex system to nonconvexities: systems, where many possible stable eqilibria exist. if the one that occurs depends on the initial conditions this is path dependency. in technology adoption a simple example is whether or not you have a single risk taking agent at the start or not. you end up with two equilibria, one where everyone adopts and one where noone does. 
iii) hierarchical nested structures are a characteristic of both socioeconomic (individual, family, household, village etc) and biophysical systems (organisms, swarms, species, ecosystems..) which means interdependencies occur across spatial scalesl, creating feedbacks, upward and downward linkages etc. 



Adaptation Adaptive mechanisms at the individual level e.g learning, evolution of strategies, at the aggregate level e.g. demographic population changes, bancrupcy etc. and the rules and institutions may also evolve over time



Emergence macroscopic emergent phenomena - no formal mathematical definition has been established. 
- "aggregate outcomes that cannot be predicted by the elements of the system in isolation." " the whole is greater as the sum of parts". Baas and Emeche : synergism (interactions) not additivity of effects. some definitions 9batty and torrens0 talk of surprise and novelty. but that is poentially probelmatic as it is a subjective cofncept. 
Examples: makret clearing price, saptial seggregation patterns, patterns of land use..



participatory models - model development and implementation, increases utility by tailoring the mdoel and analysis to the needs of the stakeholders. list of examples. from heuristic models that give stakeholders a voice in teh development f a model a dn a feel for the general dynamics of a system, to very detailed models mimicing actual systems. "teh visual communication provided byy spatially explicit models (particularly coupled with GIS) can assist in communicating model results to stakeholders and policy makers. flexibility of represenation and implementation makes them well suited for alternative scenario analysis. three types:
1. participation at all stages of model development (Bousquet..), build, un,,
2. only running, to learn more about the system 
3. scenario analysis tool for policy makers. 



Potential roles

"What kind of science are we practicing?" third way of doing science (Axelrod) inductive/deductive. 

Explanatory approaches - capturing parts of reality and focusing on particular aspects thereof. MAS as a social laboratory. Epstein: generative social science: starting from a theoretical framework and assumptions, run the model to see if the emergent phenomena of interest appears and if yes, then you have a candidate explanation, a hypothesis that can be empirically tested. this way you can assess the plausibility of an empirical expectation that flows from theories. And allows you tho check alternative explanations systematically. this is normative modelling. model specific dynamics in the hope that they will lead to testable novel hypothesis explanatory modeling approachesallow modelers to (1) demonstrate that a set of rules can lead to the outcome of interest—test theory, (2) explore other possible causes that could lead to the same out- come—formally exploring the robustness of the proposed causal explanations, and (3) discover outcomes not originally anticipated. 

Descriptive approaches are more concerned with empirical validity and empirical capacity. mimic reality to facilitate direct empirical and policy scenario research. As fully parametrized with real workd data as possible. ideally linked with models of soil fertility, hydrologic flows etc. within a GIS model even better. But this comes at a price: the real world repllicability can come at the expense of more general rules. then there is the problem that we can create an infinite number of models, but thereality is only one. We may then create a model, that reproduces a real workd phenomenon , but does not xcapture the real process behind it.


Either way, the question is what do you want to gain from the model., 





Builidng an empirically grounded model 

"The greatest simultaneous advantage and shortcomingof agent-based models is their flexibility of specification and design."

Verification - checking model structure and rules all work as intended. "examining the balance between theory and data" !?
attempts to break the model by varying model configuration. 
communication of model design - due to lack of common modelling platforms and insufficient model descriptions in publications replication is difficult. 
A key to verificaiton is sensitivity analysis of relationships between parameters, then the study of error propagation and uncertainty

Validation. How well the model outcomes represent real system behaviour. "Data are drawn from other models, theories, and observations of the target system, provided by surveys, role-playing games, interviews, censuses, and remote sensing" Outcome measures of interest can be either eggregate or the spatial distribution thereof - e.g. demographic changes, patterns of soil degradation, economic wellbeing, income distribution etc. 



Geography and validation and verivfication there are scale efects that can make them more difficult: change in spatial data is affected by the resolution. "the very synergies that makecomplex systems interesting also make them difficult to analyze"{\textgreater} 







Challenges:

Appropriate degree of abstraction, you must have a clear idea of the goal!
Is it a generalizable model, a stylized representation? or a carefully parametrized empirical model appropriate for policy and scenario analysis. 
Interdisciplinary models 

Experimental frame: placing boundaries around a subset of the real world to guide model building, data collection, modelling, validation.. spatial extent, institutions and subsystems considered, temporal period. Resolution temporal and spatial 

Scale considerations{\textgreater} especially problematic when integrating submodels across disciplines{\textgreater} they may operate at different spatial and temporal scales, which must be made compatible. "if spatial data are not available at a scale fine enough to be compatible with the minimum spatial unit at which human decision making and/or ecological processes operate, then parameterization of aMASmodel maybe difficult, andMASresultsmayneed to be scaled up for comparisons with actual data. The result may be a statistical loss of information."

Choice of decision making model{\textgreater} Even within bounded rationality there are are still numerous techniques and theoreis to use. 

Modelling institutions, social norms and other constraints on individual behaviour. 

Communication challenge. even with multiple experiments producing robust resutls, they do not have the power of mathematical proof. And may jsut seem to be like playing games.},

abstract = {We examined the principal effects of different information network topologies for local adaptive management of natural resources. We used computerized agents with adaptive decision algorithms with the following three fundamental constraints: (1) Complete understanding of the processes maintaining the natural resource can never be achieved, (2) agents can only learn by experimentation and information sharing, and (3) memory is limited. The agents were given the task to manage a system that had two states: one that provided high utility returns (desired) and one that provided low returns (undesired). In addition, the threshold between the states was close to the optimal return of the desired state. We found that networks of low to moderate link densities significantly increased the resilience of the utility returns. Networks of high link densities contributed to highly synchronized behavior among the agents, which caused occasional large-scale ecological crises between periods of stable and high utility returns. A constructed network involving a small set of experimenting agents was capable of combining high utility returns with high resilience, conforming to theories underlying the concept of adaptive comanagement. We conclude that (1) the ability to manage for resilience (i.e., to stay clear of the threshold leading to the undesired state as well as the ability to re-enter the desired state following a collapse) resides in the network structure and (2) in a coupled social-ecological system, the system-wide state transition occurs not because the ecological system flips into the undesired state, but because managers lose their capacity to reorganize back to the desired state.},

Understanding of the processes that lead to improvements in or deterioration of natural resources is limited, because scientific disciplines use different concepts and languages to describe and explain complex social-ecological systems (SESs).

Until recently, accepted theory has assumed that resource users will never self-organize to maintain their resources and that governments must impose solutions. Research in multiple disciplines, however, has found that some government policies accelerate resource destruction, whereas some resource users have invested their time and energy to achieve sustainability. A general framework is used to identify 10 subsystem variables that affect the likelihood of self-organization in efforts to achieve a sustainable SES.},

We note several reasons why our results differ from Laurie and Jaggi's. The most important of these is that Laurie and Jaggi underestimate the segregation-producing potential of weak-to-moderate preferences because they overlook a powerful interaction between preferences and ethnic demography and perform their simulations using the optimal ethnic mix for achieving integration.

abstract = {Rainfed lowland rice production in lower Northeast Thailand is a complex and adaptive farming activity. Complexity arises from interconnections between multiple and intertwined processes, affected by harsh climatic and soil conditions, cropping practices and labor migrations. Having faced a spatially hetero- geneous and dynamic environment for centuries, local rice farmers are very adaptive and are used to adjusting their behavior in unpredictable climatic and economic conditions. Better understanding is needed to manage the key interactions between labor, land and water use for rice production, especially when major investments in new water infrastructure are now being considered. Based on the principles of the iterative and evolving Companion Modeling (ComMod) approach, indigenous and academic knowledge was integrated in an Agent-Based Model (ABM) co-designed with farmers engaged in different types of farming practices over a period of three years to create a shared representation of the complex and adaptive socialeagroecological system in Ban Mak Mai village, in the south of Ubon Ratchathani province. The ABM consists of three interacting modules: Water (hydro-climatic processes), Rice, and Household. “Household” is a rule-based agent; it makes daily decisions based on its available means of production, taking into account the stage of the rice crop, and water and labor availability. Key decisions made are related to: i) rice nursery establishment, ii) rice transplanting, iii) rice harvesting, and iv) migration of household members. The spatially explicit model interface represents a virtual rainfed lowland rice environment as an archetypical toposequence made of upper to lower paddies in a mini- catchment farmed by 4 different households, and also includes water bodies and human settlements. Thanks to intensive communication, the participating farmers, made sure that the ABM adequately represents their rice farming and labor migration management practices. They found the model useful to deepen their understanding of the interrelations between labor migrations and rice production, which helped to strengthen their adaptive management ability},

abstract = {This D.Phil. thesis develops a new agent-based simulation model to improve the results of analysis, which solely uses discrete choice modelling, as well as to analyse the effects of a road user charging scheme for the Upper Derwent Valley in the Peak District National Park. The advantages of discrete choice analysis are well known. However, results with these conventional conventional approaches, which conduct analysis solely with discrete choice models, can be biased if interaction and learning effects are significant. The Minority Game, in which agents try to choose the option of the minority side, is an appropriate tool to deal with these problems. The situation in the Upper Derwent Valley can be explained with economic game theories and the Minority Game. The two approaches mutually help to analyse the situation in the Upper Derwent Valley leading to the development of a stochastic Minority Game. The stochastic Minority Game was tested with an online game (questionnaire), which was played 3,886 times by response in all around the world. The practical part of this thesis examines the components of the stochastic Minority Game with the data collected around the Upper Derwent Valley. The main data was collected using a stated preference survey. Overall, 700 questionnaires were distributed and 323 of them were returned (i.e. a return rate of 46.1 {\%}). In the practical part, the agent-based model has four sub modules: 1) Multinomial mixed logit model for mode choice, 2) Binary logit model for parking location choice, 3) Markov queue model for parking network, and 4) the Minority Game for parking congestion and learning. This simulation model produces comprehensive outputs including mode choices, congestion levels, and user utilities. The results show that the road user charging scheme reduces car demand in the Upper Derwent Valley and ensures a reduction in congestion at the parking areas. The model also shows that an exemption will increase the utilities of elderly visitors without substantially sacrificing those of younger visitors. In conclusion, the simulation model demonstrated that oversimplification in conventional approaches solely using discrete choice models gave significant biases when real world problems were analysed.},

abstract = {In Vietnam, the remarkable economic growth that resulted from the doi moi (renovation) reforms was based largely on the rural households that had become the new basic unit of agricultural production in the early 1990s. The technical, economic, and social changes that accompanied the decollectivization process transformed agricultural production, resource management, land use, and the institutions that defined access to resources and their distribution. Combined with the extreme biophysical, technical, and social heterogeneity encountered in the northern mountains, these rapid changes led to the extreme complexity of the agrarian dynamics that today challenges traditional diagnostic approaches. Since 1999, a participatory simulation method has been developed to disentangle the cause-and-effect relationships between the different driving forces and changes in land use observed at different scales. Several tools were combined to understand the interactions between human and natural systems, including a narrative conceptual model, an agent-based spatial computational model (ABM), a role-playing game, and a multiscale geographic information system (GIS). We synthesized into an ABM named SAMBA-GIS the knowledge generated from the above tools applied to a representative sample of research sites. The model takes explicitly into account the dynamic interactions among: (1) farmers� strategies, i.e., the individual decision-making process as a function of the farm�s resource profile; (2) the institutions that define resource access and usage; and (3) changes in the biophysical and socioeconomic environment. The next step consisted of coupling the ABM with the GIS to extrapolate the application of local management rules to a whole landscape. Simulations are initialized using the layers of the GIS, e.g., land use in 1990, accessibility, soil characteristics, etc., and statistics available at the village level, e.g., population, ethnicity, livestock, etc. At each annual time step, the agrarian landscape changes according to the decisions made by agent-farmers about how to allocate resources such as labor force, capital, and land to different productive activities, e.g., crops, livestock, gathering of forest products, off-farm activities. The participatory simulations based on SAMBA-GIS helped identify villages with similar land-use change trajectories to which the same types of technical and/or institutional innovations could be applied. Scenarios of land-use changes were developed with local stakeholders to assess the potential impact of these changes on the natural resource base and on agricultural development. This adaptive approach was gradually refined through interactions between researchers and the local population.},
annote = {Doi Moi economic reforms from 1860 onwards - market liberalizaion, decentralization in agriculture: from centrally planned co-operative management to family based small plots
1981: paddylands were distributed to individual households
- this forced farmers to adopt "adaptive management of agriculture, production and natural resourced" as opposed to centrally planned; a rapid transformation, social learning...
- this resulted in people adopting short-term strategies with no control by policy makers, which resulted in massive deforestation in the 1980s
- it also created a new landscape of farming systems marked by their variety as opposed to the homogenous rules of before - this makes modeling and analysis mych more challenging. 
- most empirical data was available in narrative form - 6 case studies by the authors. But these recommendations and findings are difficult to generalize to larger regions. 
SAMBA an ABM model of land use/cover change (LUCC) including stakeholder priorities + interventions and design of technical and institutional interventions. But the first model was only good for simple situations e.g. simulating the 1980s transition. But the more complex reforms of the 90s were too much. 
Participatory modeling. (Bousquet2002,Barreteau2013) 
AMB+LUCC i)abstract theoretical models for explanatory analysis AND ii) applied modeling for mimicing and predicting future scenarios. 
RPG - role-playing games: help elicit stakeholders ideas, feed into rules for individual agents in ABM, 'capturing local knowledge'
Participatory modeling is iterative; the final model is both a process of method development and a application of the result 
* a summary of vietnamese agricultural system history in the 20th century (see Castella2002) 
RPG: 10 local farmers on each site, selected to represent a variety of demographic and farm management characteristics. with the help of facilitators they recreate the local land use landscape on a grid, then draw cards representing their hypothetical resources: family, number of paddy fields and buffalos, then they manage their production.
* for an action to become a rule it either has to be repeated independently, or agreed upon by everyone as the usual way of doing things in the village. parameters are also constructed this way, yields, hours of labour required etc. 
After each round the participants' yields are added up and with the aquired virtual money they buy food to feed their family, and if there is anything left over they can reinvest. But if the balance is negative, they have to borrow.
- Usually 6 rounds- years were played in one day and htis ended with a debriefing.
The game's rules were intentionally left open for unitended situations..
* The debirefing analysed how farmers deal with uncertainty and risk, how they adapt to outcomes that were the result of decisions they made etc. Identified strategies such as repetition, imitation, innovation, co-operation. Game play was discussed and linked to actual events from their past 
Phase2: individual interviews to discuss each action they took in the game and understand teh rationale behind it. 
Using all this data on the games and rules, behaviour and parameters, the simulaiton was implemented: i) to recreate the game and ii) to simulate different scenarios that the farmers were interested in e.g. population pressure etc. 
RPG helped build trust between the researchers and interviewees and avoids getting inacurrate information, which is especially a problem in the region where people tend to just repeat the official line instead of their point of view. 
Especially minority, uneducated farmers are rarely seen as worthy of expressing their opinions by the local authorities. 
They enjoyed it as well, it is a good icebreaker, facilitated teh communication and interraction with the researchers. 
SAMBA model is set up so that households first produce enough food to suport (rice to feed) themselves before moving to cash crops, even though they could so it the other way round, but empirical evidence suggests this is the normal behavior. Probably a consequence of food shortages in the 1980s and also shows the cultural importance of rice in Vietnam. 
The final model allows individuals - who usually have only a partial view - to apreciate thecomplexity of their village system and feel empowered by their contribution to this representation of the system. People with no computer experience and illiterate people are able to grasp the model rules and structure.

annote = {Gathering impetus from 1990 from computer science. becoming more and more used in the social sciences eg in economics as "agent based computational economics", in social sciences as "social simulation"


Instead of statistical analysis of behavioural data, the abm approach presupposes behaviour rules and tries to challenge their validity by showing whether or not they can produce observes macroscopic regularities. 


1990 - this computational approach has created a vast amount of literature, from so-called evolutionary computation (genetic algorithms etc) to the study of the social evolution of adaptive behaviours, learning, innovations.. Contrary to experimental approaches, ABM presupposes rules of behaviour. Main emphasis is on explanation rather than prediction.


"argue that ABCD is a promissing stream of research that can improve our understanding of demographic behaviour". 


Gilbert and Troiztch for scientific logic differenc between statistical and simulation approaches!
- statistical model is an abstraction of a social process. it is worthy to the extent of the similarity between what it predicts and what is observed in the collected data. 
- simulation model creates simulated data to be compared with collected data 


Also cite Axelrod's third way of doing science. 



Gap between theory and techniques in Demography:

there seems to be a gap between theories of behaviour and applied methodologies



Microsimulation has long been used in demography, especialy in family and kinship networks and family life cycle research, reproduction, migration etc. But adding amb to the list would be advantageous because:
- easy to include feedback loops and micro-behaviour theories (and e.g. results from event history models etc) with aggregate level demographic outcomes. 
- heterogenous agents that are not fully rational are easy to include
- keep it simple stupid
- not limited to mathematical tractability. even if the model could be solved analytically, abm is still sweet, because their output is mostly visual *Axtell) and easier to communicate to people outside academia. 
- instead of being interested in the long term stable equilibrium, we can study the dynamic path of the process under study. 



Difficulties
and Challenges

- if you-re modelling a "thin" activity, where most social interactions have very little effect on the process you are interested in.
- not necessarily easy to collect the required data



Agent based models in spatial demography

- Schelling - racial seggregation. The starting hypothesis is that the micro behaviour of agents is based on a "threshold" of tolerance. The result is that even with a relatively high level of tolerance spatial seggregaion emerges nevertheless. So micro behaviours whose macro effect is not apriori clear we create macro behaviours that are similar to those observed in reality. 


Heiland model of migration east and west germany
Benenson et al model migration in tel aviv



Agent based models in family demography

"because decision making processes are key object of study in this field. and interaction between individuals (in the marriage market) is a fundamental aspect of family demography"


Todd and Billari: partnership formation, decision making based on satisficing heurisitic{\textgreater} simple psychologically plausible mechanisms within the framework of bounded rationality. Then the population level macro patterns, the age of marriage rates are compared to observed patterns. 


Billari et al look at the more general implications - the long term persistence of cultural norms on demographic behavoiur. ie age norms or rather age at marriage norms, which get transmitted to the next generation (of course by those who do get married and have kids!). model shows tht under certain conditions these norms can have long term persistence, and also that the initial situation is very important / model exhibits path dependence. 



ABM for historical processes and population-development-environment interactions

Small-scale populations, primate and human societies. Extra cool, because this approach allows for controlled experimetns, especially for ancient societies for which only indirect data is available. *Anasazi, based on sugarscape (!) 


Murphy et al think that microsimulation modelling of historical populations has often lead to greater variability than that actually observed in human populations, so they use ABM to add a feedback loop from macro to micro (ala Malthus's positive checks) whereby population size affects nuptuality. so importance of modelling the micro-macro link


Ewert et al investigate mortality crises in premodern eurpoean towns - famine, plague and storm tide, show the importance of modelling the heterogeneity of the population since different shocks will have affected different population groups differently. 


Koenig et al extend sugarscape by adding soem agents that act as co-ordinators and other as subservients from which a hierarchy emerges, which makes it easier to achieve sustainability!



Potential roles for ABM in demography

microsimulation is used a lot, in them individual states are changed based on predefined probabilities or transistion rates estimated by the researcher. 


in ABM simulation is used first of all to develop and explore theories rather than to evaluate empirically the consequences of given rates/probabilities.
operationaly you need to{\textgreater}
- elaborate a theory that explains individual behaviour *influenced both at the micro or macro level
- formalize it and express it in a way that can be translated into a computer programme. 
- run the programme with enough agents to observe results at both micro and macro levels. 


1. Individual agents have a central role


. 

Macro level units can be added of course, and then the feedbacks as well..
2. Heterogeneity of agents is also central!
3. Social interaction between agents
4. Focus on dynamics rather than equilibria as opposed to formal demography which is focussed on stationary and stable population processes
5. Explanation via social mechaminsms / ABM as a usefull mechanism for formulation theories
6. simplicity of propositions and emergent phenomenta

abstract = {This paper presents a spatial multi-agent programming model, which has been developed for assessing policy options in the diffusion of innovations and resource use changes. Unlike conventional simulation tools used in agricultural economics, the model class described here applies a multi-agentkellular automata (CA) approach by using heterogeneous farm-household models and capturing their social and spatial interactions explicitly. The individual choice of the farm-household among avail- able production, consumption, investment and marketing alternatives is represented in recursive linear programming models. Adoption constraints are introduced in form of network-threshold values that reflect the cumulative effects of experience and observation of peers' experiences. The model's economic and hydrologic components are tightly connected into a spatial framework. The integration of economic and hydrologic processes facilitates the consideration of feedback effects in the use of water for irrigation. The simulation runs of the model are carried out with an empirical data set, which has been derived from various data sources on an agricultural region in Chile. Simulation results show that agent-based spatial modelling constitutes a powerful approach to better understanding processes of innovation and resource use change. 0 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Sociologists often model social processes as interactions among variables. We review an alternative approach that models social life as interactions among adaptive agents who influence one another in response to the influence they receive. These agent-based models (ABMs) show how simple and predictable local interactions can generate familiar but enigmatic global patterns, such as the diffusion of information, emergence of norms, coordination of conventions, or participation in collective action. Emergent social patterns can also appear unexpectedly and then just as dramatically transform or disappear, as happens in revolutions, market crashes, fads, and feeding frenzies. ABMs provide theoretical leverage where the global patterns of interest are more than the aggregation of individual attributes, but at the same time, the emergent pattern cannot be understood without a bottom up dynamical model of the microfoundations at the relational level. We begin with a brief historical sketch of the shift from "factors" to "actors" in computational sociology that shows how agent-based modeling differs fundamentally from earlier sociological uses of computer simulation. We then review recent contributions focused on the emergence of social structure and social order out of local interaction. Although sociology has lagged behind other social sciences in appreciating this new methodology, a distinctive sociological contribution is evident in the papers we review. First, theoretical interest focuses on dynamic social networks that shape and are shaped by agent interaction. Second, ABMs are used to perform virtual experiments that test macrosociological theories by manipulating structural factors like network topology, social stratification, or spatial mobility.

ABM: 4 ley assumptions:
i) agents are autonomous, there is no central co-ordination, although there may be external constraints
ii) agents are interdependent
iii)agents follow simple rules - the simplest set of behaviours sufficient to explain emergent patterns
iv) agents are adaptive and backward looking
*ABMs tend to focus much more on theoretical development and exlanation rather than prediction.
- ABMs defy classification ass either macro or micro - they proveide a theoretical bridge between the two (Saam1999)
- AMBs are most apropriate for processes that lack central conrol, where simple local interactions between agents generate stuff like diffusion of information, emergence of norms, coordination of conventions or participation in collective action. 

Sociology - ABMs used to focus on i) emergent structure e.g. from homogeneity to social differentiation or vv. or ii) emergent social order e.g. how egoistic adaptation can lead to collective action.
* "the model used as an experiment (parameters are manipulated to test for predicted differences) or a demonstration (parameters are manipulated to test for robustness)
EMERGENT STRUCTURE: convergence and differentiation
- the "paradox of mimetic divergence" - mimicing fit neighbours does not converge in a single profile, rather the system achieves a stable diversity. Even if you add homophily - the greater tendency to hang out with similar people - you still don't achive cultural convergence and homogeneity!

The BBN models represent the ecological causal web of key environmental correlates (KECs) that most influence habitat capability, potential population response for each species, and influence of habitat planning alternatives. BBN models represent site-specific KECs, habitat capability at the subwatershed level, and pattern of habitat capability across all subwatersheds. BBNs use Dirichlet prior probability distributions and standard Bayesian updating of posterior probabilities. We derived estimates of prior and conditional probabilities from a mix of empirical data and expert judgment, mostly the latter. Sensitivity analyses identified planning decisions and KECs that most influence species outcomes, and can help prioritize monitoring activities. BBN models, however, substitute for neither field studies nor empirical, quantitative population viability analyses of population demography and genetics.},

abstract = {Simulation models that describe autonomous individual organisms (individual based models, IBM) or agents (agent-based models, ABM) have become a widely used tool, not only in ecology, but also in many other disciplines dealing with complex systems made up of autonomous entities. However, there is no standard protocol for describing such simulation models, which can make them difficult to understand and to duplicate. This paper presents a proposed standard protocol, ODD, for describing IBMs and ABMs, developed and tested by 28 modellers who cover a wide range of fields within ecology. This protocol consists of three blocks (Overview, Design concepts, and Details), which are subdivided into seven elements: Purpose, State variables and scales, Process overview and scheduling, Design concepts, Initialization, Input, and Submodels. We explain which aspects of a model should be described in each element, and we present an example to illustrate the protocol in use. In addition, 19 examples are available in an Online Appendix. We consider ODD as a first step for establishing a more detailed common format of the description of IBMs and ABMs. Once initiated, the protocol will hopefully evolve as it becomes used by a sufficiently large proportion of modellers.},
annote = {Propsed standard protocol - developed within ecology.


ABMs - widely used not only in ecology, but social sciences, economics, demography, geography, political sciences.


Beyond analytical models, because they can include variability among individuals, local interactions, complete life cycles, adaptation to internal and external evnicontment.


But ABMs are more complex in structure than analytical models, more difficult to analyse, understand, communicate (Grimm1999). Analytical models can be described completely, unambigousy and acessibly, contrary to ABMs, which also makes them less reproducible. Just generally difficult to read in publications. Lengthy verbal descriptions and justifications make it hard to extract relevant information for understanding and implementing the model. 


ODD standard protocol - general structure and - mathematical language. Original model Grim and RAilsback 2005, then extensively tested


1. overview - purpose, state variables and scales, process overview and scheduling - general overview shoudl be enough to write the skeleton of the model. 
2. design concepts - integrates the model into the framework of Complex Adaptive Systems science. 
3. details - initialization, input, submodels. all data omited from the overview, this should be everything required to completley re-implement the model- 


1.1. purpose: explains why some aspects of reality are inculded whileothers are ignired. Why you want to build it and what you are going to do with it.
1.2. State variables and scales. What are the agents, how are they described, what hierarchical levels exist, what iw the world, spacial and temporal resolution. 
1.3. process overview and scheduling : which processes are built in e.g. food production, feeding, growth, movement, mortality, reporcution.. Scheduling refers to the order of the processes - the order iwn which the state variables are updated. WHich processes are grouped together. flow charts can help or pseudo code.
2,1, design concepts *emergence - which phenomena truly emerge from individual traits. *adaptation - what adaptive traits fo individuals have to improve their fitness * fitness (or other objectives e.g. revenue) - how do individuals calculate it? *prediction - how do individuals predict the future conditions *sensing - which state variables do the agents "know". * interactions among individuals, *stochasticity is there any, why? * collectives - are there social groups *observation: how are data collected from the model?
3.1. Initialization how is the environment and individuals created at the start, what are the initial values, do they vary across simulations. 
3.2 input imposed dynamics of the environmental sysem - percipitation, management regimes etc. 
3.3. submodels representing the processes - a skeleton, and then a more detailed full model description. 


ex 1.1. "to understand how the social behaviour of marmots - in particular territoriality, reprocudtive suppression and hibernation - affects population dynamics and in particular extinction risk". 
ex.2.1 stochasticity - "all demographic and behaviorla parameters are interpreted as probabilities or are drawn from empirical probability distributions"


The rprotocol only describes the basic model. not scenarios, simulation experiments and sensitivity analysis. These are effectiely carefully designed experiments to test certain hypotehsis that should be clearly stated. But this is not model description.

But how can technology fit best with such a novel means of support? Even the present participatory modeling method is not really designed to avoid this technocratic drift and encourage the empowerment of stakeholders in the land use planning process. In fact, to truly integrate people and principals in the decision-making process of land use management and planning, information technology should not only support a mere access to information but also help people to participate fully in its design, process and usage. That means allow people to use the modeling support not to provide solutions, but to help people to steer their course within an incremental, iterative, and shared decision-making process. To this end, since 1997 we have experimented at an operational level (2500 km2) in the Senegal River valley a Self-Design Method that places modeling tools at stakeholders' and principals' disposal, right from the initial stages. The experiment presented here links Multi-Agent Systems and Role-Playing Games within a self-design and use process. The main objective was to test direct modeling design of these tools by stakeholders, with as little prior design work by the modeler as possible. This},

These people were prehistoric ancestors of the modern Pueblo cultures of the Colorado Plateau. Paleoenvironmental research based on alluvial geomorphology, palynology, and dendroclimatology permits accurate quantitative reconstruction of annual fluctuations in potential agricultural production (kg of maize per hectare). The archaeological record of Anasazi farming groups from anno Domini 200-1300 provides information on a millennium of sociocultural stasis, variability, change, and adaptation. We report on a multiagent computational model of this society that closely reproduces the main features of its actual history, including population ebb and flow, changing spatial settlement patterns, and eventual rapid decline. The agents in the model are monoagriculturalists, who decide both where to situate their fields as well as the location of their settlements. Nutritional needs constrain fertility. Agent heterogeneity, difficult to model mathematically, is demonstrated to be crucial to the high fidelity of the model.},

Simulation is a type of modelling. "LIke statistical modelling simulations have inputs entered by the researcher and outputs which are observed as simulation runs"


Example from Todd (1997) - partnership choice: do you keep searching until you've found the ideal, or do you stop when you've found someone good enough. You can't go asking people about their searching behaviour, because it is unlikely to be a consious thing, but you can model various plausible behaviours to see if you end up with realistic patterns. 


So this is an example of using simulation for obtaining a better understanding. You can also use it for prediction, as a substitute for human capabilities (expert systems), for training (simulators) or even entertainment (SimCity)


In social sciences it is important as a way of formalizing theory - you have to be able to formulate it precisely as a computer programme. As opposed to mathematical formalization, simulaiton is easier to understand, more expressive, can account for parallel processes way better than systems of equations. They are also modular, and can accou nt for agent heterogeneity. 


Microsimulation - a large random sample of individuals, aged using a set of transition probabilities, and then you can calculate aggregate statistics. There is no pretesions to explanation, just predicting future fiscal distributions. The individuals are modelled individually, without interactions between them, and they have no intentions or motivations. 
But that was about it when it came to simulation in the social sciences up until the 1990s, then as a result fo the development of multi agent models, imported from techniques for the study of nonlinear dynamics and artificial intelligence research. In particular cellular automata from physics and mathematics. And in AI, in the 1980s the interest started to focus on distributed artificial intelligence. Because these models involve interacting intelligent agents they are quickly applicable to human societies.


One important feature of simulation is that it can account for non-linear behavoiurs, which are studied by complexity theory. They cannot be understood analytically. They can be explained through simulation, but that doesn-t mean they are predictable!
Another important thing to come out of complexity theory is the concept of emergnece. " a phenomenon is emergent if it requires new categories to describe it which are not required to describe the behaviour of the underlying components" e.g temperature is an emergent property of the motion of atoms as individual atoms have no temperature.


Simulation is also useful for theories involving spatial location - neighbourgood effects, either on actual terrain, or ca type grid cells. And rationallity in particular the effects of bounded rationality can be modelled



Stages in simulation research

- designing a model / what goes in and what stays out. In general there is a trade off between the model's accuracy and its simplicity. . If you want predictive capacity you need more accurate data and assumptions, if you want understanding, simplicity is an andvantage. 
- Building a model
- verification (debugging, version control, test cases, careful with random seeds) and validation (comparing to external target process. butnot expecting perfect correspondence.. watch out for path dependence. there is also the possibility the model is correct but the data isn't. Also the model may be so abstract it is difficult to figure out what to validate against? eg Schellings segregation one. 
- sensitivity analysis
- publication







Chapter 8 -Multi-agent models 172-




agent - "self-contained programmes that can control their own actions based on their perceptions of their operating environment" *Huhns and singgs 1998 / readings in agents


Agent software has been ifluenced by artificial intelligence work, especially "distributed artificial intelligence", "concerned with the properties of and the design of networks o interacting agents / for example how one might design a group of agents, each with a different expertise, to cooperate to solve a problem". 


There is a lot in this field relevant to social simulation, and vce versa, those in the DAI field are increasingly interested in social simulaiton


According to Wooldridge and Jennings 1995 agents in computer simulation have the following 4 characteristics{\textgreater}
- autonomy - act without others directly controling them
- social ability - interact with other agents through a 'language'
- reactivity - to their environment based on their perception of it
- proactivity - can take initiative and engage in goal - directed behaviour


So you want them to have 
- knowledge and beliefs - information may be wrong, incomplete, based on faulty logic..
- inference - may come up with information based on other information, but not necessarily correctly
- social models - they may be capable of creating models of the interrelationship between other agents and learn about their social relatinships in the environment., or of the geography etc
- knowledge representation - a way of representing an agent's beliefs.
- goals - survival or other subsidiary goals. problem of managing several goals, which might be in conflict
- planning - what behaviour is going to lead to the satisfaction of the goals?
- language - between agents, or with the environment. may just convey factual menaing (true or not), or communication , negotiation... A problematic assumption may be that there is a perfect correspondence between language and the agent-s representation in the world
- emotions - not clear how they should best be modelled. are they emergent (eg from satissfying a goal) or are they a goal in their own right. 



agent architecture

then there is the question of concurrency! because you're running the model sequentially, not all agents in parallel, so if B says sth to A, but a was run before B, A will only find out in the next time step...},

abstract = {The resilience perspective is increasingly used as an approach for understanding the dynamics of social–ecological systems. This article presents the origin of the resilience perspective and provides an overview of its development to date. With roots in one branch of ecology and the discovery of multiple basins of attraction in ecosystems in the 1960–1970s, it inspired social and environmental scientists to challenge the dominant stable equilibrium view. The resilience approach emphasizes non-linear dynamics, thresholds, uncertainty and surprise, how periods of gradual change interplay with periods of rapid change and how such dynamics interact across temporal and spatial scales. The history was dominated by empirical observations of ecosystem dynamics interpreted in mathematical models, developing into the adaptive management approach for responding to ecosystem change. Serious attempts to integrate the social dimension is currently taking place in resilience work reflected in the large numbers of sciences involved in explorative studies and new discoveries of linked social–ecological systems. Recent advances include understanding of social processes like, social learning and social memory, mental models and knowledge–system integration, visioning and scenario building, leadership, agents and actor groups, social networks, institutional and organizational inertia and change, adaptive capacity, transformability and systems of adaptive governance that allow for management of essential ecosystem services.},

The primary objectives of ODD are to make model descriptions more understandable and complete, thereby making ABMs less subject to criticism for being irreproducible. We have systematically evaluated existing uses of the ODD protocol and identified, as expected, parts of ODD needing improvement and clarification. Accordingly, we revise the definition of ODD to clarify aspects of the original version and thereby facilitate future standardization of ABM descriptions. We discuss frequently raised critiques in ODD but also two emerging, and unanticipated, benefits: ODD improves the rigorous formulation of models and helps make the theoretical foundations of large models more visible. Although the protocol was designed for ABMs, it can help with documenting any large, complex model, alleviating some general objections against such models.},

annote = {"The advantage of agent-based social simulation is thatit can combine the problem orientation and commitment to observation of the sociologist and anthropologist with more formal approaches and arguably more careful methodology of the natural scientist. "


"We argue that agent-based social simulation supports a new methodology that itself provides a suitable framework within which to collect observations of the social and physical systems, to generalise from those ob- servations and to identify relationships and processes that must be understood before policies to deal with climate change and its effects can usefully be formulated."


Cimate change - as an interface between physical and social sciences (physical and socio-economical modellign) is dominated by an economist's view of modelling decision making as a cost-benefit problem. 


"Since the target systems of integrated assessment modelsare large, complex physical, biological and social systems, experience would not lead us to expect experimental valida- tion of the models. Moreover, the very size and complexity of these systems individually aswell as their combined com- plexity ensures that no model that we can comprehend will be correct and complete. Our models can be no more than a set of descriptions of what we observe together with suppo- sitions about currently unobservable relationships that help to make our descriptions of the observablemore comprehen- sible to us. So our purpose is not to find a correct theory in the sense of a theory providing accurate predictions of fu- ture events but rather to find descriptions of the phenomena of interest that help us to formulate plans of action to miti- gate adverse outcomes and to enhance positive outcomes"


"Models of the relevant natural systems will natu- rally cohere with experimentally and observationally estab- lished relationships. Models of relevant social systems can only cohere with observationally established relationships. Some of these relationships will be described by indepen- dent observers and some by stakeholders."


"We submit that a powerful approach is to represent the actors by means of computer programs that take as input represen- tations of perceptions by the real actors, that process those perceptions in order to produce outputs corresponding to the actions of the real actors. " ... "What is novel about the approach suggested here is the direct involvement of stake- holders as participants in the specification and evaluation of the agent-based social simulation models. " "A feature of this involvement is that the stakeholders specify the conditions leading to various observed behavioural patterns and are then involved in either the corroboration of the outputs from the models as accurate or at least plausible or, if they cannot offer such corroboration, the identification of any misspecifi- cation of behaviour or relationships that will have generated the inaccurate or implausible results. Stakeholder participation in this way provides an important basis of model vali- dation. " see Vennix 1999 for group model building.

However, the rationale for choosing a particular human decision model is often not sufficiently empirically or theoretically substantiated in the model documentation. Furthermore, it is difficult to compare models because the model descriptions are often incomplete, not transparent and difficult to understand. Therefore, we expand and refine the ‘ODD' (Overview, Design Concepts and Details) protocol to establish a standard for describing ABMs that includes human decision-making (ODD + D). Because the ODD protocol originates mainly from an ecological perspective, some adaptations are necessary to better capture human decision-making. We extended and rearranged the design concepts and related guiding questions to differentiate and describe decision-making, adaptation and learning of the agents in a comprehensive and clearly structured way. The ODD + D protocol also incorporates a section on ‘Theoretical and Empirical Background' to encourage model designs and model assumptions that are more closely related to theory. The application of the ODD + D protocol is illustrated with a description of a social–ecological ABM on water use. Although the ODD + D protocol was developed on the basis of example implementations within the socio-ecological scientific community, we believe that the ODD + D protocol may prove helpful for describing ABMs in general when human decisions are included.},

Agents can marry each other only if they share part of the acceptable age interval. We perform several simulation experiments on the evolution across generations. In particular we study the conditions under which norms persist in the long run, the impact of initial conditions, the role of random mutations, and the impact of social influence.

increased interest in studying social norms within ABM. What is the representation of a social norm? as built in constraitns, as built in ends (goals) or as built in obligations. 
ABM is also a natural toolkit for exploring the evolution of norms, or long term equilibria where several norms can co-exist within a population. 
Their ABM has a age-at-marriage proscriptive norm. It is a built in constraint and doesn't change during the agents lifetime. The questions adressed are:
- the long term persistence of norms
- the long term impact of the initial distribution
- the impact of random mutation and social influence. 

each agent:
- li - lower limit of aam
- ui - upper limit of aam

G0 - generation 0's norms are initialized randomly, with li drawn from unifrom distributions and ui made higher. 
- each year individuals with compatible norms marry, have children and transmit their norms according to some mechanism
Agents do not age, everything happens in one step.. reproduction is simplified, age doesn't matter, just keeping the population stationary.

explore 4 different mechanisms of transmission:
- intersection 
- union
- random
- uniform (between both lower and both upper)
Individuals also get assigned one of the transmissions
Mutation:
random (child initialized at random like original agents)
social influence: bounds set to avera ge of parent generation and mode of transmition 

Experiments. 
1. pure intergenerational transmission, no mutations, only one possible mechanism of transmision. 
-intersection elads to rapid convergence of norms
-union leads to rapid dissolution of norms

abstract = {In this paper we propose an agent-based approach to the modeling and simulation of invasions of brown plant hoppers in the Mekong Delta. Although these seasonal invasions are now heavily studied and their factors quite well known, it is still difficult to predict in advance where and when the next occurrence will appear. As a matter of fact, the conjunction of particular local weather conditions, global winds, biological characteristics of rice crops, agricultural decisions in Vietnam and in the surrounding countries (mainly Cambodia and Thailand), prevent analytical models from delivering interesting results. One of the only options is then to build predictive simulation models, with the constraint that they have to rely on accurate spatial and weather data, and have to represent the knowledge about the various heterogeneous "actors" that play a role in these phenomena (from the insects themselves to the farmers or local authorities). After a short review on similar researches, we argue that agent-based modeling is likely the most interesting approach to fulfill these requirements and we present the methodology we have used to design our model (BPHSim). This model and its implementation are detailed, and followed by an overview of its validation against real data. Then, we discuss the different research directions that this approach will allow us to take in order to tackle the more complicated problem of decision-support when an invasion is predicted.},
annote = {BPH are shit. Techiques for fighting off the invasions are numerous (pesticides, simultaneous cropping, GMOs, introduciton of new predators?) none terribly succesful especially because they tend to depend on anticipating well in advance where and when the outbreaks will occur. But the patterns of migration of the BPH, which follow the dominant winds for long distance travels are extremely difficult to anticipate at smaller scales. 
They present a model to reproduce the dynamics of these invasions at district level. 
Scale: at a regional level there is no need to model each individual insect, but swarms instead, or each individual field etc. But there is a collection of models atdifferent scales
all the models are fed data on the biological characteristics of BPH, historical time series of invasions, land use etc. from the Soutern regional plant protection center.
Hmm, so they set up a ABM with districts as agents, which have reproduction and propagation submodels for swarms of BPH. Taking rice growth and wind into account they then run the model to see infestations.

I compare models that do and do not include feedback mechamisms using the SOCSIM monte carlo simuation program with approximately fixed stationary values of fertility, mortality and nuptuality, but with only nuptuality depending on the population size in an approximation to the household formation models of Hajnal and Wrigley and Schofield. Standard Monte Carlo micro simulation models show greater variability than is observed in the dynamics of human populations. Negative feedback mechanisms lead to more realistic patterns of growth within an agent based framework. Nuptuality adjustment is sufficient to maintian population homeostasis in most caes. Parity specific adjustment does not lead to major differences from the unconstrained model, and a stem family system that promotes the nuptuality of one son appears to provide little advantage in perpetuating lineages compared to the unconstrained model.},
address = {Heidelberg},
annote = {"As a species we have lived on the edge of extinction for almost all our existence. "
Basically our growth rate has been very close to zero for all except the past 200 or so years. 
factors that influence population change are macro (asteroids, famines), micro (fecundity, outcome of pregnancy) and intermrediate (chance of finding a suitable mate). 
Demographic research has focused on micro and intermediate levels, through both analytical and empirical simulation, but so focus is on reproduction and partnership formation through probabilistic approaches, but this provides little insight "into the apparent fine tuning of long-term population grownt [..] a fraction lower and we would be extinct, a fraction higher and global population numbers would be nonsensical. 
Despite being subject to random (macro) influences it has managed to maintain a very precise stable long term growth rate except fpr teh last two centureis or so. 
The most widely used model for population dynamics is the cohort component model, deterministic, and does not have mechanisms for establishing targets for its outcomes!
Instead we want a realistic model that can incorporate feedback mechanisms, and ideally a model that is sensitive to stochastic variability. 


So Matlhus described the macro micro link as as the external constraints imposed by natural resources. If pressure is low then preventative checks are used, if pressure is high then positive checks are used. In low pressure regimes tehre is more behavioural choice than in high presssure regimes


Individual level stochastic variablity. Distribution of children in 1911 census, the assumption is only heterogenous fecundity but generally no deliberate attept to reduce family size. So huge range of distribution, due mainly to chance. 


ABM approach here wrould have the following advantages: reduce excessive random variability in demographic microsimulation processes, set the limits on the extent to which a particular strategy may be achieved in practice, and may be able to discriminate among different hypothesized strategies. It in particular allows for various units to have different behavioural rules to be specified. "this application does not cosnider emergent behaviour or social learninng" (but really, isn't a stable population dynamic emergent?



Assess the variability of conventional microsimulation the distribution after 500 runs and 500 years is considerably wide. the average growth rate is close to zero, there are substantial numbers of trajectories. Variance essentially increases linearly, this behaviour resembles a random walk. so:
- models that don't include some sort of feedback are unrealistic, because we expect populations to behave differently if the population falls below or above a long term viable value
- the degree of variability is greater than expected
- if you're (generally) more interested in means than variances, you need alarge number of replications to mimimize this random variations. 



Now the regime adjusts to populaiton pressure. mortality (positive check), nuptuality or fertility (preventative check). According to Wrigley and Schofield nuptuality was the main mechanism of demographic adjustment. so is it strong enough? 
So the model adjusts the nuptuality at every time step by a factor inversely proportionat to the target population size. This simple feedback mechanisms substantially reduces the variability. So even a simple check like this can stabilize the population without recourse to positive checks. 



Then the kin group level is added. First born son has the advantage of inheritance and therefore increased nuptuality 


So: negative feedback loops give a more realistic pattern of growth, nuptuality is sufficient to maintain population homeostasis in most cases.},

abstract = {Agent-based simulation (ABS) is being increasingly used in environmental management. However, the efficient and effective use of ABS for environmental modelling is hindered by the fact that there is no fixed and clear definition of what an ABS is or even what an agent should be. Terminology has proliferated and definitions of agency have been drawn from an application area (Distributed Artificial Intelligence) which is not wholly relevant to the task of environmental simulation. This situation leaves modellers with little practical support for clearly identifying ABS techniques and how to implement them. This paper is intended to provide an overview of agent-based simulation in environmental modelling so that modellers can link their requirements to the current state of the art in the techniques that are currently used to satisfy them. Terminology is clarified and then simplified to two key existing terms, agent-based modelling and multi-agent simulation, which represent subtly different approaches to ABS, reflected in their respective artificial life (A-life) and distributed artificial intelligence roots. A representative set of case studies are reviewed, from which a classification scheme is developed as a stepping-stone to developing a taxonomy. The taxonomy can then be used by modellers to match ABS techniques to their requirements.},

@article{Bacon2002,
abstract = {A two-stage model of land use change is described, which is driven by the types of decisions that land managers make when changing their broad styles of use. The first stage uses decision modelling techniques to assess if a manager is currently satisfied with the present situation, when compared to various potential alternatives. If this evaluation indicates satisfaction, it is assumed that the present land use will continue. However, if it indicates dissatisfaction, Belief Network techniques are used to estimate, in more detail, both how dissatisfied the manager is and whether the costs of changing, from the present use to a potentially better one, will be out-weighed by the anticipated benefits. The proposed models can use a variety of cost and benefit criteria (e.g. financial, social and ecological). The approach is illustrated with a case-study of the factors that might influence changes from farming to forestry in marginal upland areas of the UK.},

So theory and empirical research need to draw strength from each other, Goldthorpe 1996 suggests rational choice theory as the one to bridge the gap, but the authors argue sociology need not limit itself to one substatnive theory. "Rather it needs general methodology for more closely integrating theories of the social with the results of quantitative research. 



empirically calibrated agent based modells (ECA) can integrate both.AGm (unlike rational choice theory) is a methodology, not a specific theory of action and interaction. 


Micro macro chart: we know a lot about how individuals are influenced by the social and how ind. affect other ind, but teh link between ind. and social outcomes is not so well understood. "a general methodlolical tool for analzsinf the link between individual actios and social outcomes". Becasue the social is not simply an aggregate of the individual level entities and actions. 


One criticism against ABM is that thez have used it as an exclusively theoretical took for assessing the outcomes of different stylised logics.. e.g. Macy and Willer 2002 "ABM is a new tool of theoretical research" thought experiments etc.


but by empirically calibrating the model we can use it as a virtual laboratorry to examine how various microlevel changes are likely to affect higher level changes. 


non-emmpirical models mean we make up a rule for how actor's opinions and actions are influenced by others, instead we use statistical analysis to arive at a specification that as closely as possible mirrors actual interactions and influences. 


ECA can therefore allow for testing how well teh abm brings about the social outcome it seeks to explain and provides a micro-macro link to derive social levle implications of a set of quantitative research results. 


Importance of social interactions: three types: opportunity based, belief based and desire based. 


OK, so they use regressions, one for each month, to identify neightbourhood level unemployment relevant characteristics, using the demographic data of teh individuals in each neighborhood, to get each individual's predicted probability of being unemployed to get the expected unemployment level for each neighborhood. 


Of course there turns out to be a lot more variation in unemployment that the expected level, and the authors think this must be due to the "social interaction effect"


So they do a discrete-time event history model, where they do a logistic regression on all the unemployed person-years. Simple model shows unemployment in neighborhood has very big effect, even when they control for a bunch of covariates, the effect is still strong. 


Then they build a simple ABM, 2500 agents on 50x50 grid, rooks neighborhood, use probability based on the coefficient from the logistic regression to determine if an individual stays unemployed or not. And tehy get a very segregated patter very quickly. 
but of course this model has a very simple interaction structure (4 neighbors) and takes no heterogeneity into account. Also it is a "state-of-nature" type model, where only the current situation is important, and no history is taken into account. 


So a true ECa uses the 87000 agents with acual demographic characteristics. the agents interract with their actual neighborhood peers.
the agents become unemployed when the real people did, they age and move and everything. 
the Action: leaving unemployment is influenced by their social and demographic characteristics, the unemployment level among their neighborhood peers, the tighness of the labour makret. these are all taken from the logistic regression model


the experiment changes the extent to which each factor is important. 


using the actual (from teh model) level of social interaction as teh baseline, they can tehn explore counterfactuals{\textgreater} if there was less sicial interaction the unemployment rates would have been lower, if there were more, they would have been higher, also the interaction has a magnifying effect: in low unemployment areas no social interaction has less of an effect than in high unemployment areas, where it reduces unemployment relatively more. To see how strong these effects they compare with the effects of education and find the strength is on par with them. This tehn allows us to make teh claim that suck proceses were actually at work and most likely of considerable importance.

1. Start with developing a stylized agent-based model that explicates the logic of the mechanism assumed to be operative. Simulate the model in order to examine generative sufficiency (Epstein and Axtell 1996), that is, make sure that the model can generate the type of social outcome to be explained. If the model exhibits generative sufficiency, we have a mechanism-based explanation of the outcome, but the explanation has not yet been empirically verified.2. For empirical verification, use relevant data to examine the most important bits and pieces of the causal machinery in order to verify that the mechanism actually works as postulated.
3. Examine generative sufficiency when the agent-based model has been modified in the light of (2) and after controls for likely confounders have been introduced.
